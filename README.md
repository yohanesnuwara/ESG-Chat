ESG-Chat is a programmatic chatbot that can answer queries related to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) or sustainability topics. It's like ChatGPT for ESG. For corporates, being engaged in sustainability is important. We can use this chatbot to give us advice and strategy on how to improve sustainability.

Why use this method? Naive GPT models like ChatGPT sometimes can hallucinate because we don't give **context** to it. Because sustainability is core to business, hallucinating is something that we must avoid if we want to implement chat bot for this purpose.
