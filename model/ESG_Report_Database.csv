While this report covers the  progress we made in FY20, our  key areas of focus continue in  FY21. Most recently, our partners  have seen a substantial wage  increase; our renewable energy  investments are benefitting our  stores and the communities  around them; we have set new    inclusion and diversity goals and  commitments ; we committed  to invest $100 million to support  small businesses and community development projects in Black,  Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) neighborhoods ; we added  another $50 million to our global coffee farmer fund; and we’re  doing more each day. We have a unique opportunity at Starbucks to use our reach   and scale to create a better society in many ways, big and small. I have immense gratitude and pride for all Starbucks partners  who have worked together through this historic time in service  of their communities, creating a third place where we can all find  community, acceptance and a sense of belonging."

Starbucks_25,"Our partners have continued to show up for their communities  in the face of extraordinary circumstances, and we are  committed to keeping partner care front and center. In the early months of the pandemic, we provided partner  benefits that included service pay, catastrophe pay, benefits  continuation, expanded mental health support, expanded  backup childcare support, and food and beverage allowances –   with no involuntary layoffs. We also initiated a $10 million  emergency relief fund for partners in both company-operated  and licensed retail store markets around the world. As stores began to re-open, we announced a COVID-19 Leave  of Absence policy for partners who preferred to take unpaid  leave while keeping their existing Starbucks benefits and  eligibility for unemployment assistance available. Thousands of  partners took advantage of this policy."

Starbucks_120,"We also doubled down on investments in successful,  long-term strategies like mobile pantries, which help overcome  transportation and access barriers by bringing food to families  where they are. As a result of these initiatives, Starbucks donated  more than 8.9 million meals in FY20, as well as $1 million to mobile  pantry programs. As the needs of food banks increase, we continue to learn from the  many logistical challenges of ongoing perishable food delivery so  we can increase the scale of this program. Internationally, similar  food donation programs exist in several markets, including a  FoodShare program in Canada and food waste diversion programs  in 14 countries across EMEA markets.INCREASED STORE SUPPORT Launch of Outreach Worker Pilot in Five Cities Goal: Provide store partners support to address customers with  critical needs In FY20, Starbucks launched a one-year Outreach Worker pilot  program with United Way Worldwide .

The SBTi has confirmed that our  scope 1 and 2 portion of our 2030 carbon target is aligned with a  1.5°C pathway, the most ambitious level they validate. To meet our 2030 goals, we set five key strategies, rooted in  science, grounded in Starbucks Mission and Values, and informed  by comprehensive market research and trials:  •  Expand plant-based menu options  •  Shift away from single-use to reusable packaging   •  Invest in regenerative agriculture, reforestation, forest  conservation and water replenishment in our supply chain  •  Invest in better ways to manage our waste  •  Innovate to develop more sustainable stores, operations,  manufacturing and delivery1 2 3 We are governing our sustainability commitments through our  Global Environmental Council, which is comprised of senior  leaders across Starbucks whose compensation is tied to  performance against our goals."
Starbucks_165,"We also formally review and seek  counsel from our Board of Directors Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee, along with informal advisors who are  experts and influencers in the sustainability sector. From FY19 to FY20, we are able to report an 11% reduction in  carbon emissions against our 2030 carbon goal; 4% water  reduction against our 2030 water goal; and 12% reduction in waste  against our 2030 waste goal. This level of annual reduction at this  stage in our journey toward our 2030 targets was not anticipated  and is due primarily to reduced business activity in FY20 as a result  of COVID-19; it is not likely to be typical going forward. They are  also due, in part, to improvement of data availability and quality as  we improve our environmental impact measurement process. 2020 Global Environmental & Social Impact Report  |  16 © 2021 Starbucks Corporation."
Starbucks_170,"PLANETIMPACT SUMMARY FY20 PROGRESS PLANT-BASED LAUNCHES Oatmilk, Meat Substitutes Expanding Starbucks plant-based menu globally is one of the ways  we are pursuing our carbon reduction goal. Our aim is to provide  customers with a variety of choices. Starbucks stores around the  globe launched new plant-based menu options  in FY20. Most  significantly, Canada, China and the U.S. introduced oatmilk; the  U.S. introduced the Impossible™ Breakfast Sandwich; and Canada  and China introduced breakfast sandwiches using Beyond Meat®  products. NEW EFFORTS TO REDUCE CARBON AND REPLENISH WATER An Update on Our Progress  As we work to invest in regenerative agriculture, reforestation,  forest conservation and water replenishment in our supply chain,  we launched pilots in FY20 in Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Rwanda  and Kenya focused on working toward reducing our environmental  footprint in green coffee."
Starbucks_175,"This included alternative coffee  processing and new wet mill innovations designed to save up to  80% of water, as well as precision agronomy practices – such as  analyzing soil and leaves – to help reduce our carbon footprint. Through our partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF),  we’re leveraging WWF’s Water Risk tool  to map our highest risk  basins and better understand the challenges in those basins  across origin countries and store communities, helping ensure  long-term access to freshwater. And in FY20, we joined the new Transform to Net Zero  initiative as  a founding member. Comprised of nine founding members, the  Initiative’s objective is to accelerate the transition to a net zero  global economy no later than 2050 by developing and delivering  research, guidance and roadmaps to guide businesses in achieving  net zero emissions.2020 Global Environmental & Social Impact Report  |  17 © 2021 Starbucks Corporation. PLANETIMPACT SUMMARY FY20 PROGRESS MANAGING WASTE FROM CUPS AND STRAWS Five New Markets Recycling, Strawless Lids in   U.S. and Canada Goals: 20% recycled content in our hot cups by 2022 Develop 100% compostable and recyclable hot cups by 2022 Elimination of plastic straws by the end of 2021 In partnership with Closed Loop Partners  and the NextGen  Consortium , we worked in FY20 toward our goal to develop 100%  compostable and recyclable hot cups."
Starbucks_180,"In FY20, five new markets  joined the list of major markets where Starbucks hot cups are  recyclable: Kent County, Mich.; Lansing, Mich.; Sioux Falls, S.D. ;   St. Lucie County, Fla.; and Athens County, Ga. They join 13 other  major markets: Seattle; Washington, DC; Denver; New York;   San Francisco; Boston; Louisville, Ky.; Dallas; Vancouver; London;  Amsterdam;and Chattanooga, Tenn. In Canada, stores are funding  in-store recycling where it’s possible. As we work to shift away from single-use plastics and champion  the use of recycled content in packaging, our hot cups contain  10% post-consumer fiber."
Starbucks_185,"In FY20, we joined the Ellen MacArthur  Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment  that’s  centered around a vision of a circular economy for plastic in which  it never becomes waste. In doing this, we committed to:  •  Take action to help eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic  packaging by 2025. •  Take action to move from single-use towards reuse models  where relevant by 2025. •  Take action for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable,  recyclable or compostable by 2025. •  Use 5-10% recycled content across all plastic packaging by 2025."
Starbucks_190,"In our effort to eliminate one billion plastic straws a year, we are  on track to meet our 2021 goal. In FY20 we completed the rollout   of strawless lids across the U.S. and Canada, which we modeled  after our hot drink lid and has approximately 9% less plastic than  the flat lid and straw historically used for iced beverages. Unlike  traditional plastic straws, the strawless lids can be recycled in  many markets in the U.S. and Canada. We also signed the U.S.  Plastics Pact  as a call to action for a better waste infrastructure.1 2 3 REUSABLE CUPS Researching Incentives, Testing Single-Use Fees Goal: Double the use of reusable cups from 2016-2022 COVID-19 safety measures challenged our ability to allow  customers and partners to use personal cups and “for here” ware   in our stores, and we paused on those initiatives while using FY20  to conduct consumer and market research to better understand  how best to incentivize the use of reusables. In FY20, 1.3% of  beverages sold were in reusable cups, either a customer’s personal  cup or “for here” ware, in company-operated stores in Canada,  EMEA, Japan and the U.S."
Starbucks_195,"Meanwhile, we tested single-use cup  fees in UK and Germany . And in the UK, Starbucks launched the  Circular Cup , a reusable cup made in the UK from approximately six  single-use paper cups. 2020 Global Environmental & Social Impact Report  |  18 © 2021 Starbucks Corporation. PLANETIMPACT SUMMARY FY20 PROGRESS GREENER STORES 2,317 Stores to Date Goal: Build and operate 10,000 stores in the Greener Stores  framework globally by 2025 Through our open-source Starbucks Greener Stores framework ,  developed in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and  in collaboration with other nongovernmental organizations, we  have created a new benchmark in retail for design, construction  and operation. In FY20, our second year of certifying stores, we  tripled the number of stores in the Greener Stores network to a  total of 2,317 certified stores in the U.S. and Canada."
Starbucks_200,"Circumstances  surrounding COVID-19 slowed some areas of progress, but it also  provided an opportunity for us to build on learnings from our first  year to optimize standards to reflect the needs of our diverse store  portfolio. We also saw stores improving their adoption of Greener  Store standards, such as energy efficiency and recycling, thanks  in part to partners’ growing interest and motivation surrounding  sustainability.RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR STORES AND COMMUNITIES Powering 72% of Operations Globally Goal: Invest in 100% renewable energy to power operations  globally by the end of 2020 Worldwide, Starbucks purchases enough renewable energy to  power 100% of our company-operated locations in the U.S.,  Canada and Europe, and 72% of company-operated locations  globally, with market constraints in China and Japan challenging  our ability to reach our 2020 goal. As members of the RE100, we  remain committed to reaching 100% renewable energy globally   as access increases in Asian markets. A priority in FY20 was expanding our roster of renewable energy   projects in the U.S., supporting the growth of green energy onto the  grid close to the stores that use the energy. We used our scale to  drive innovation across the energy sector and support not only our  stores but also the communities around our stores:  •   In New York state, Starbucks invested nearly $97 million in up to  23 new community solar projects, which will supply solar energy  to 24,000+ households, small businesses, nonprofits, churches,  universities and Starbucks Stores."
Starbucks_205,"•  In Virginia, we finalized an agreement with a solar farm that will  offset 50% of our company-operated roasting and beverage  production sites’ electricity consumption in the U.S. by 2022. •  In California, we launched the company’s first next generation  on-site solar store, and we have entered into a Virtual Power  Purchase Agreement (VPPA) and Virtual Storage Agreement (VSA)  that will provide renewable energy for more than 550 of our  stores with solar energy and utility-scale batteries. •  At home in Washington state, a new wind project is providing  renewable energy to about 140 of our stores and our Kent  Roasting Plant, along with numerous nearby communities.GREENER PARTNERS 28,000 Partners Enrolled in Greener Apron Goal: Empower 10,000 partners to be sustainability champions  by the end of 2020 With growing interest among our partners in sustainability, more  than 28,000 worldwide have now enrolled in in the Greener Apron  sustainability training program through Starbucks Global Academy. We continue to expand opportunities for partners to engage on  sustainability, in part because increased awareness and adoption  of environmentally friendly practices among partners is key to the  success of our overall sustainability goals. 2020 Global Environmental & Social Impact Report  |  19 © 2021 Starbucks Corporation."

Coalition members commit to collective action in water- stressed basins, to develop and implement resilient practices  across their industry, and to provide leadership and advocacy in  the field of water stewardship. South Korea’s Planet Positive Commitments In April, Starbucks Coffee Korea announced  bold commitments  including reducing its carbon footprint by 30% and eliminating  single-use cups by 2025. Cup-Borrowing Programs In early FY21, we tested cup-borrowing programs in stores in Japan  and Seattle, in which customers received a reusable cup to take  with them and return later or at a different store. This spring, we  built on these learnings to scale our cup-borrowing program to  five stores in Seattle.Forest Conservation and Restoration Early in FY21, Starbucks launched projects with Conservation  International (CI) to protect and restore at-risk forests in key  coffee landscapes near our supply chains."
Starbucks_215,"Over the next five years,  CI and Starbucks will work together on forest conservation and  restoration programs in Colombia and Peru that will help carbon  sequestration efforts and benefit freshwater ecosystems and  surrounding coffee communities. Win-Wins with Dairy Farmers Starbucks is now supporting the Dairy Net Zero Initiative, a  partnership of the U.S. dairy community seeking to achieve net  zero greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in water quality  on farms. We’ve also joined the Farm Powered Strategic Alliance  as a founding member, which uses food waste from our supply  chains to produce low carbon fertilizer that dairy farmers can use  to support their regenerative agriculture practices.

Starbucks_220,"We are committed to  sourcing coffee responsibly, for the betterment   of people and planet, so we can ensure a  sustainable future of coffee . FY20 PROGRESS ETHICALLY SOURCED COFFEE 98.6% in FY20 Goal: Committed to 100% ethically sourced coffee in  partnership with Conservation International From 2015 to 2019, 99% of Starbucks coffee was verified as  ethically sourced as measured by C.A.F.E. Practices, our ethical  sourcing verification program developed in partnership with  Conservation International. Measuring farms against economic,  social and environmental criteria, the C.A.F.E. Practices program   is designed to promote transparent and sustainable coffee  growing practices while also helping protect the well-being of  coffee farmers and workers, their families and their communities."
Starbucks_225,"In FY20, due to restrictions caused by COVID-19, auditing teams  were unable to complete all the necessary in-person, on-farm  audits of our coffee production, resulting in expiration for farms  whose verification ended in FY20 and were not audited. This  resulted in 98.6% of our coffee coming in FY20 from C.A.F.E. Practice-verified farms.FARM COMMUNITY SUPPORT Nine Farmer Support Centers,   200,000 Farmers Trained Goal: Train 200,000 farmers by the end of 2020 More than 40,000 farmers were trained in FY20, enabling us to  reach our goal of training 200,000 farmers by the end of 2020. Starbucks operates nine Farmer Support Centers worldwide,  where agronomists and quality experts work alongside coffee  farmers – whether they sell to Starbucks or not – to share tools  and information to help increase the productivity, quality and  profitability of coffee on their farms and improve their livelihoods. In FY20, due to COVID-19 restrictions, we incorporated online  training tools and resources to continue these efforts while  supporting the health and safety of our partners, suppliers,  farmers and their communities."
Starbucks_230,"COFFEE TREES 50 Million to Date, 10 Million in FY20 Goal: Provide 100 million trees to farmers by 2025 In FY20, we distributed 10 million trees to farmers in Mexico,  Guatemala and El Salvador. Over the past five years as part of our  10-year, 100 million-tree commitment, Starbucks has donated  nearly 50 million coffee trees to farmers. These new trees are bred  to be resistant to coffee rust, a disease associated with climate  change, and they’re replacing trees declining in productivity, which  can, in turn, help farmers improve the quality and yields of their  harvest and improve their revenue. 2020 Global Environmental & Social Impact Report  |  21 © 2021 Starbucks Corporation. COFFEEIMPACT SUMMARY FY20 PROGRESS FARM COMMUNITY SUPPORT Childcare Centers  Goal: Strengthen our coffee communities In FY20, Starbucks launched a new initiative in Guatemala focused  on providing safe spaces for local and migrant workers’ children  to continue their education during the coffee harvest season."
Starbucks_235,"Five  new centers opened during the 2020-21 harvest season, with   co-investment from coffee suppliers and implementation by  FUNCAFE  and Coffee Care. Starbucks also established a $100,000  Capital Improvement fund to support initial and on-going  childcare center improvements, along with preparing childcare  center locations to open in a safe and welcoming way.STARBUCKS DIGITAL TRACEABILITY Launched for Consumers, Testing Among  Farmers Goal: Create connection between coffee farmers and coffee  consumers; empower farmers and support coffee farm  communities As a continuation of our ethical sourcing commitment, in FY20 we  launched the new Starbucks Digital Traceability  web tool, which  provides a way for customers to engage directly with their coffee  and learn more about its journey, from bean to cup. Customers  can use the traceability tool to scan a bag of their favorite coffee  at a Starbucks store, discover the global origin of their beans,  and read about the farmers who grow it. We are continuing to  explore how digital tools can empower farmers and best support  farming communities by leveraging the traceability technology  and platform to give farmers the ability to trace their coffee beans,  so they can see where their beans go and the final product they  become. In FY20 in Rwanda, we piloted a call-in platform for  farmers to get agronomy tips and green coffee price information  for their local markets."
Starbucks_240,"More than 19,000 farmers used the service  over three months. ETHICAL TEA AND COCOA Tea: 99.7% in FY20, Cocoa: 100% in FY20 In FY20, we sourced 99.7% of tea from Rainforest Alliance certified  farms. For cocoa-based beverage ingredients, 100% of cocoa  beans are ethically sourced from either COCOA Practices-verified  supply chains or UTZ certified farms. The UTZ program is now part  of the Rainforest Alliance. We continue to strengthen our approach,  programs and partnerships for sustainably sourcing tea and cocoa.GLOBAL FARMER FUND         EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS  $42.9  Million to Date      $2.8  Million in FY20 Goal: $50 million in farmer loans by the end of 2020 The Starbucks Global Farmer Fund was founded to improve  supply chain resiliency and ensure a long-term supply of coffee  by addressing the unmet financing needs of farmers."
Starbucks_245,"As of FY20,  we have invested $42.9 million in the Fund, partnering with  Root Capital  and ResponsAbility  to provide coffee businesses  and farmers with access to low-interest loans in regions where  traditional banks are not an option due to high interest rates. Loans  allow farmers to plant new trees and improve their infrastructure. In addition, we have continued our Emergency Farmer Relief Fund  for a second year to further support farmers who were negatively  impacted by low global coffee prices. These secondary payments  go directly to smallholder farmers in Central America to subsidize  their income, helping to offset low prices compared to cost of  production. Although market conditions were slightly better than   in FY19, we distributed more than $2.8 million to farmers in  Guatemala and Nicaragua in FY20."

RECENT AWARDS AND  RECOGNITION View our timeline  of awards and recognition.7Our Commitment to Net Zero by 2040 Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time. It has already affected many aspects   of society and has the potential to cause even greater disruption, threatening populations,  economies, food security, resources, and more. At Xerox, we have long believed that businesses  — like ours — play a critical role in protecting the health of the planet and that’s why we  continue to take decisive action. Given the urgency, we fast-tracked our net zero goal by 10  years and established 2040 as our new goal year."
Xerox_45,"We plan   to achieve net-zero emissions through projects that improve  operational efficiency, create new technology innovations,   and neutralize residual GHG emissions through carbon  compensation mechanisms. To reach our goal, we will need all  employees to understand how their jobs impact GHG emissions  and take steps to reduce or eliminate them. Because we require  everyone on board, it is important that our employees have a  base understanding of climate change and our organization’s  targets and goals. In 2022, we launched a Net Zero training for  our employees to educate them on the basics of climate  change, the organization’s  plan to reduce emissions, and  communicate opportunities to participate in emissions  reduction activities. Since establishing our first targets in 2003, we have achieved   a significant reduction in our energy consumption and GHG  emissions."
Xerox_50,"Between our first baseline year of 2002 and 2016,  we eliminated 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e). In 2016, we created a goal to reduce Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions by an additional 25% by 2025, which  we achieved by the end 2019. Our focus now is to reduce our  Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by at least 60% by 2030 against  the company’s 2016 baseline. When this goal is met, we will  have reduced emissions by 85% compared to the company’s  original 2002 baseline year.For Scope 3 emissions, we formalized a goal of a 35%  reduction by 2030. For the past two decades, we have required  our suppliers to meet stringent environmental, health, and  safety objectives."
Xerox_55,"We will intensify our efforts and work  collaboratively with our supply chain and stakeholders to  achieve this. Our approach to sustainability has included partnerships to  accelerate progress. In 2021, our targets for all three scopes  received approval from the Science Based Targets Initiative  (SBTi), validating that the goals we set align with actions  necessary to limit the worst impacts of climate change. We  have officially joined the UNFCCC’s Race to Zero and SBTi’s  Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaigns, aligning our climate  mitigation targets with the most ambitious aim of the Paris  Agreement and what science dictates is necessary to reduce  the destructive impacts of climate change on human society  and nature: to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

Xerox_60,"For two weeks, attendees  participated in negotiations and agreements to prevent the  degradation of our natural environment and protect our future. Alongside heads of state, academia, and business was the Xerox  team — both center stage and behind the scenes. We were awarded the contract to be the official print provider  for the conference, overseeing the printing of over half a  million pages on our FSC-certified paper, having 100% Post- consumer recycled content. Our company deployed more than  200 print devices, which were certified to meet security and  environmental standards. The devices earned Electronic  Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT), Blue Angel,  and ENERGY STAR ecolabels and were validated by The United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  for their security and functionality."
Xerox_65,"In addition to being behind the scenes, we took part in the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)’s  Technology for Climate Action e-alliance panel. DEFRA’s  e-alliance partners’ program, a coalition of 300 technology  companies, was set up in 2018 to develop a roadmap to a  sustainable future through technology. Darren Cassidy,  managing director of Xerox U.K. and Ireland and senior vice  president of EMEA Enterprise Services and Software, spoke  alongside representatives from other global technology  companies about the need for collaboration and holding  ourselves and each other accountable through transparent  reporting. Xerox was awarded the Terra Carta Seal, launched by King   Charles III in his former role as His Royal Highness The Prince   of Wales, through his Sustainable Markets Initiative. The inaugural  2021 Terra Carta Seal recognizes global companies that are driving  innovation and demonstrating their commitment to creating  genuinely sustainable markets and aligning with the ambitions   of the Terra Carta recovery plan for Nature, People and Planet,  launched in January 2021."
Xerox_70,"The Terra Carta Seal has been awarded to 44 private sector  companies from across the world that hold a leadership  position within their industry and have credible transition  roadmaps underpinned by globally recognized, scientific  metrics for achieving net zero by 2050 or earlier. The Terra Carta Seal was presented to the awardees at a  ceremony during the 2021 UN climate change conference  (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland. 10Xerox Honored with the Terra Carta Seal 11Pioneering a Circular Economy Our first commercial product in 1959, the Xerox 914, introduced  electronics remanufacturing long before the term “circular  economy” became popular. Our vision was to transform Xerox  manufacturing, operations, offices, and facilities into waste-free  workplaces. We had the same vision for our clients’ workplaces: a world  where electronics and supplies at the end of their useful life  would come full circle to become raw materials for tomorrow’s  technology."
Xerox_75,"In this model, quality and performance are not  compromised, precious natural resources are conserved, and  waste becomes obsolete. Six decades later, we continue to  demonstrate that a circular economy delivers environmental,  economic, and societal benefits.CIRCULAR ECONOMY AT XEROX An integral part of enabling a Circular Economy is Designing for  Sustainability, recognizing that products have environmental,  social, and economic effects throughout their lifecycle. We  design products to be environmentally responsible, from parts  selection to efficiency in operation, while extending the life of  parts and enabling reuse in manufacturing. • Parts & materials selection • Product ecolabel certification  — design for repair, upgrade,  reuse, recycle, longevity,  energy conservation, end   of life management,  sustainable packaging • Collection for reuse and  recycling of equipment   and consumables• Reuse and remanufacturing  of equipment and  consumables • Reduced energy consumption  & emissions • Service & maintenance  efficiencyDesign Manufacturing Extended Life Use 12DESIGN PHASE – PARTS AND MATERIALS SELECTION Design goals are established for each product at the start   of the development cycle. They include selecting parts and  materials that are safe for use and the environment."
Xerox_80,"Our safety  and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations  governing chemical use. Since 2006, our newly launched  products have been designed to meet the European Restriction  of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) requirements in all markets. However, where regulations allow and promote the circular  economy, some products may contain parts with small  amounts of RoHS substances to avoid the premature disposal  of existing components with a usable life. Many other market regions continue to implement similar types  of legislation governing chemical use. Through our proactive  regulatory tracking process, we maintain compliance with all  aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective  and applicable."
Xerox_85,"In 2021, we reported no issues with non- compliance to RoHS in any markets. The company has long worked toward minimizing the use   of hazardous substances in our products. In support of this  objective, we apply strict internal standards and have deployed  requirements to our suppliers, such as EHS&S 1001 Xerox  supplier requirements . This standard governs the use of  chemicals in our products, parts, and supplies. Additionally,   it sets strict requirements for chemical bans, restrictions, and  part-marking."
Xerox_90,"It is aligned with IEC62474, an International  Standard for the electronics industry on material declaration,  and updated twice annually with IEC revisions. The standard  sets out the requirements for regulatory compliance, chemical  bans and restrictions, and parts-marking for parts and  materials intended for use in electronic products and  packaging. In addition, we proactively collect data from   our suppliers on the presence of Registration, Evaluation,  Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACh) regulated  substances to provide information to downstream users and  regulatory agencies. All suppliers must meet these requirements as a condition   of doing business with Xerox. Our engineers use these  standards when designing new products."
Xerox_95,"If a substance is  identified above an acceptable threshold, we have proactive  supplier engagement through our supplier quality and  engineering functions to eliminate it when technically feasible. We have made a long-term commitment to eliminate the use  of persistent bio-accumulative and toxic materials throughout  our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and  tightly managing chemicals. Our supplier requirements are  periodically updated as regulations change, and new  information becomes available. All new product designs refer  to these requirements and suppliers are expected to verify   their compliance with them. Xerox toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of  new materials in our products to ensure conformance with  applicable global registration, hazard communication, and  waste handling and disposal requirements."
Xerox_100,"Our strict standards   set firm controls on the types of materials approved for use in  our consumable products. These products do not cause adverse  developmental or reproductive effects; pose a toxicity hazard  to humans or aquatic species; cause a permanent adverse  effect to the skin, eyes, or respiratory system; or have the  potential to generate federally regulated hazardous waste. The company sells imaging supplies through our distribution  network that are manufactured by other companies for use   in other OEM printers. We review these supplies to ensure  compliance with appropriate regulatory requirements and   our own stringent standards. DESIGN PHASE – ECOLABEL CERTIFICATION Design goals also include a comprehensive set of sustainability  elements, largely framed around the Electronic Products  Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) ecolabel criteria."
Xerox_105,"EPEAT is composed of criteria encompassing corporate and  product requirements. Product criteria reflect several  categories of environmental attributes that span the lifecycle  of electronic products: design for repair, upgrade, reuse,  recycle, product longevity, energy conservation, end-of-life  management, and sustainable packaging.Design13Since 2014, we have committed to launching all new eligible  office products with EPEAT Silver or Gold certification. We have  achieved this goal consistently on all newly manufactured  offerings for the past five years. All new Xerox® VersaLink®,  Xerox® AltaLink®, and Xerox® PrimeLink® Products are EPEAT  Gold-certified, with a few country-specific exceptions, and the  new Xerox® VersaLink® C Series and B Series printers and  multi-function devices are EPEAT Gold or Silver in all  geographies. Xerox is one of two companies to claim all eight  EPEAT corporate optional criteria in the U.S."
Xerox_110,"Learn more  about  the EPEAT program and view current Xerox ecolabel registered  products. At Xerox, we integrate lifecycle thinking into our product   and service development and innovation activities. Lifecycle  Assessments (LCAs) are a means of technically evaluating the  environmental and health impact of a product’s materials,  manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life. LCAs are  completed according to the appropriate ISO standards to  quantify the environmental impact of a product throughout its  lifecycle. We currently have completed LCAs for approximately  60% of our products, including the AltaLink, VersaLink,  PrimeLink, and Xerox B and C series products."
Xerox_115,"These LCAs  directly contribute to Xerox earning EPEAT Gold certifications. The company continues to support EPEAT initiatives, future  successes, and global expansion. We register products in the  U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium,  Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and  Denmark. A second ecolabel, applicable to office products, is the Blue  Angel ecolabel of the federal government of Germany. Its  governing body, RAL gGmbH, regularly introduces progressively  more stringent requirements."
Xerox_120,"Approximately 50 Xerox®  Products are currently registered, and Blue Angel certified. These products have achieved or exceeded the rigorous  requirements set forth by DE-UZ-219 for chemical emissions,  materials selection, recyclable design, and energy  consumption, effective January 2022. Going beyond current ecolabel requirements, our organization  has been increasing the amount of post-consumer recycled  plastic content in printers, multi-function devices, and toner  cartridges. In 2021 and early 2022, we introduced printers and  multi-function devices with 10–25% post-consumer recycled  (PCR) plastic content, and 21 % PCR for the associated toner  cartridges. The trend to incorporate more PCR and post- consumer materials reuse into Xerox equipment and  consumables will continue in the future."
Xerox_125,"USE PHASE – ENERGY CONSUMPTION Sustainability is a key consideration in Xerox® Technology,  influencing not just our industry but others. Serving as an  ENERGY STAR Charter Partner, we helped the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) create its standards  and still work with the agency today. Since 1993, more than  500 Xerox® Products have achieved ENERGY STAR registration;  since 2010, 100% of our eligible new products have achieved  this designation. Many existing products were re-engineered to  be more energy-efficient to meet the 3.0 criteria that became  effective in October 2019. Over the years, we have cut the  power consumption of our laser-based printing products by  making adjustments in the fuser design, changing properties in  our toner, developing more efficient electronic controls, and  improving the performance of the xerographic system."
Xerox_130,"A recent  example is the launch of the Xerox® B310 Printer, which uses  30% less energy than its predecessor product. As a general  rule, Xerox® Printers and Multi-function Devices are designed  with energy conservation features such as duplex, N-up  printing, energy savings modes, high-yield cartridges, and  smart print drivers.In addition, goals have been established to reduce single-use  plastics and increase the amount of recycled plastic in  packaging. We strive to eliminate, reduce, reuse, and recycle  packaging whenever feasible. Product teams actively seek   out more environmentally responsible packaging alternatives. We also require packaging suppliers to comply with bans   and restrictions for a variety of chemicals."
Xerox_135,"We document  expectations in the EHS Requirements for Packaging Standard  — EHS -710 . Commercial equipment is designed and tested to  be shipped with minimal packaging. Eliminating or reducing  packaging, wherever feasible, conserves natural resources and  decreases fuel use for distribution — a sustainability win-win  for business and the environment Use14In 2020, we collaborated with the EPA to roll out ENERGY STAR  criteria for remanufactured products, referred to as revision 3.1. As a pioneer in remanufacturing, the company provided inputs  on the terms and definitions as well as the prerequisites that  remanufactured products are required to meet for certification. We subsequently launched three new remanufactured models  under the new Xerox factory-Produced Program in 2021 that  certified to ENERGY STAR 3.1."
Xerox_140,"We also collaborated with the  EPA in the development of professional imaging products  criteria, released as revision 3.2 in November 2021. USE PHASE – MACHINE EMISSIONS Consistent with the world’s most stringent ecolabels, we design  products to control chemical emissions. As a result, our current  products have achieved emission levels that are well below the  global regulatory requirements — often at or near the  detection limit of our measurement equipment — and are  considered to have a negligible impact on our clients’ work  environments. We publish emissions data for our products in  our product safety data sheets (PSDS). USE PHASE – REMOTE SERVICE Many Xerox® Devices are enabled for remote service, bringing  automation to common tasks, allowing clients more efficient  use of their time, and quicker problem resolution."
Xerox_145,"Xerox Remote  Services is the infrastructure and mechanism by which client  devices communicate with Xerox, providing access to a suite   of time-saving capabilities. When enrolled, a device will send  meter readings, supply levels, and diagnostic information. Monthly billing will be done automatically, and toner can be  replenished without ever needing to place an order. Clients can  also elect to receive automatic software upgrades and security  patches. If the printer should have an issue, the diagnostic  data sent by the machine will be used by our Digital Support  Experts to troubleshoot and resolve your issue promptly.EXTENDED LIFE PHASE – TAKEBACK AND RECYCLING Consumables Starting more than 20 years ago with the 5090-product family,  the company has kept toner cartridges out of landfills thanks  to our remanufacturing process, which recovers toner  cartridges and waste toner for reuse."
Xerox_150,"The sale and use of Xerox® Products and supplies continued to  be down in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact  on the office and supply chain. Despite the challenges of the  pandemic, we were able to maintain a steady stream of  remanufactured toner cartridges in our production facilities. In 2021, more than 1.9 million Xerox® Toner Cartridges were  manufactured using recovered cartridges, representing as  much as 50% of toner cartridge production, depending on the  cartridge family. Central to this effort is the Xerox Green World Alliance® (GWA),  a collection and reuse/recycling program for spent  consumables. GWA efficiently manages supplies at end-of-life  and recovers materials for reuse in our supplies and products."
Xerox_155,"As a result, this program reduces the demand for raw materials  and diverts them from landfills. After changing out a toner cartridge, clients can return spent  cartridges to Xerox via single returns, Eco boxes, or pallets. We  continue to enhance the cartridge take-back program enabling  easier returns for toner cartridges and expanding country  participation. Returned toner cartridges are collected by our partners —  Close the Loop in the U.S., Greiner Associates in Europe, and  SCI in Canada — and managed using a specially designed  manual and robotic process that scans and identifies products  based on their codes. Spent toner cartridges are unboxed,  assessed for damage, disassembled, cleaned, inspected, and  packaged for shipment to our offices."
Xerox_160,"Toner collected from  spent cartridges is used for color additives or returned to us   for reprocessing.Extended Life15If items are not suitable for remanufacturing, they are recycled  or recovered through energy from waste. Recycled waste toner  and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualifies for  reuse may account for 25% of the new toner’s weight without  compromising toner functionality. Reusing waste/reclaimed  toner saves several million dollars in raw material costs each  year. Of the toner that cannot be reclaimed, 75% is recycled by  our consumables recycling partner, while the remaining volume  is sent to a third party that processes it for generating steam  and electricity. More than 35 countries currently participate in the Xerox GWA."
Xerox_165,"In 2021, our clients from around the world returned over 4.58  million cartridges, toner containers, and other used supply  items, equaling 2,000 metric tons, 1,600 metric tons less than  in 2020. This decrease was driven by the continued global  impact on the office environment in response to the COVID-19  pandemic. As people continue returning to the office, we  expect to see an increase in the total number of returns.Equipment We at Xerox are committed to collecting and reusing  equipment at the end of its useful life. In geographies where  we exercise direct control over the end-of-life management of  equipment, return rates are high. In 2021, 6,415 metric tons of  equipment and parts-related waste were diverted from landfills  to be recycled at our U.S."
Xerox_170,"Reverse Logistics Center. Globally,  that volume rose to 17,810 metric tons.

Xerox_175,"• Remanufacture or conversion into a newer-generation  product or part: Product families are designed with a high   level of commonality to maximize reuse. This allows us to  remanufacture parts to “like new” performance specifications  while reusing 70–90% of the machine components by weight,  without degrading quality or performance. In 2021, we  remanufactured approximately 10,740 office devices, with  8,200 metric tons of electronic devices and components  diverted from being potentially discarded at landfills or   through other forms of uncontrolled disposal.• Used equipment: Equipment returns are evaluated for  potential reuse. Based on the condition and market demands,  equipment may be put through an extended maintenance   and verification process to return it to a high standard before  redeploying it. In 2021, approximately 43% of machines  returned in the U.S. were sold as used or sent for  remanufacturing."
Xerox_180,"• Reuse of major modules, subcomponents, and parts for  spares or manufacturing: Many machines that have outlived  their useful life are stripped of usable parts and components  before the scrap/reclaim process. Used spare parts returned  from the field by our service technicians are also included in   this reuse stream. We have continually increased the number   of reused components in upstream and downstream processes  after the original machine has been designated for recycling. • Material recycling: After the processes noted above have been  followed, any remaining portion of a machine is stripped of any  recyclable material (e.g., plastics, copper wire) and material  requiring special disposal services, such as printed wire boards,  batteries, and lamps. The remainder is then sent to an industrial  reclaim facility."

Xerox_195,"3D Printing and Digital Manufacturing Complex global supply chains leave manufacturers and their  customers vulnerable to external risks. This point has been  driven home during the past two and a half years between the  global pandemic and other issues that resulted in massive  disruptions in supply chains around the world. Elem Additive,  our additive manufacturing (AM) business, has developed  solutions that can help manufacturers more easily deploy local,  on-demand 3D printing to increase the flexibility and resiliency  of their supply chains while also reducing their carbon footprint  and hidden costs like transportation and warehousing. Xerox® ElemX® 3D Printer is a groundbreaking 3D metal printer  that’s simpler and safer to use and addresses supply chain  resiliency for transportation, aerospace, defense, and industrial  manufacturing. The printer is easily deployed and requires  minimal post-processing, providing a faster time-to-part than  other 3D technologies."
Xerox_200,"The ElemX uses cost-effective aluminum  wire as an input, so unlike other powder-based technologies,  there are no special facility modifications required, and it  eliminates the explosion risk associated with powders. At the end of 2020, we established a strategic collaborative  project with the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) to  evaluate the use of 3D printing throughout the U.S. Navy. This collaboration included the first installation of the  ElemX®3D Printer at the NPS campus in Monterey, CA, in late  2020.

We also recover warm air from our compressor rooms  when the outside temperature is low to limit the need to  preheat intake air. • We have an ongoing program that targets lighting energy  efficiency through migration to LED lighting in our  manufacturing and research facilities."
Xerox_255,"• We improve product manufacturability and reduce the energy  needed for production. For instance, we have modified some  conventional toner products to incorporate more friable raw  materials, thus improving the ease with which it can be ground  down to the ultrafine sizes needed in our toner products and  significantly reducing the grind time and energy use. Here are some key points about the information presented   in this section:: • Figures on air emissions, releases, water use, and hazardous   and non-hazardous waste represent total quantities for our  manufacturing, research, development, warehouse, and  equipment recovery/recycle operations. • Statistics on energy and GHG emissions represent total  quantities for our manufacturing, research, development,  warehouse, and equipment recovery/recycle operations, offices,  and data centers. Normalized values from 2016 onward have  been calculated using Xerox revenue from continuing  operations."
Xerox_260,"Unless otherwise noted, values represent worldwide  totals, and are reported in commonly used international units.• Data is based on actual measurements to the extent possible. Vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are our preferred  source of data, when available. Where direct measurements are  not available, we employ engineering calculations or estimates. At Xerox, we continue to strive to increase the accuracy of the  data we report. Major manufacturing sites and some administrative offices  employ an Environmental Management System (EMS) that  conforms to ISO 14001:2015."
Xerox_265,"The EMS: • Establishes a framework to ensure compliance with regulations  and Xerox standards; • Identifies environmental effects considering a lifecycle  perspective and sets objectives and performance targets; • Identifies, manages, and addresses risks and opportunities  related to environmental aspects, compliance obligations,   other issues or needs, and expectations of interested parties; • Strives for continual improvement by conserving natural  resources, eliminating toxic and hazardous materials,  preventing pollution, and recovering, reusing, and recycling  materials; • Ensures integration between day-to-day business activities,  environmental planning, and program management; and • Encourages innovative engineering solutions, creative  partnerships, and employee involvement. Our major manufacturing operations have been certified   to ISO 14001 since 1997. Quarterly status meetings and   an environmental performance scorecard provide visibility,  best-practice sharing, and innovation across our operations.NRESPONSIBLE  CONSUMPTION   AND PRODUCTIONCLEAN WATER AND SANITATIONAFFORDABLE AND  CLEAN ENERGYCLIMATE ACTION24TRACKING GREENHOUSE GASES   Under the international guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute and the  World Business Council for Sustainable Development, we track  the six major GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),  nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),  perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). As  noted, we express our carbon footprint in terms of carbon  dioxide equivalents (CO2e). Our GHG inventory includes direct emissions from the  combustion of fossil fuels in our facilities, primarily natural gas,  and the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service  and sales vehicle fleet (Scope 1)."
Xerox_270,"Indirect emissions included in  the inventory primarily result from purchased electricity and  steam at our manufacturing sites, offices, warehouses, and  electric service vehicles (Scope 2).MANAGING ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GASES We recognize that energy costs and security are issues that  affect our operations, suppliers, and clients. Given that energy  sources account for most of our GHG emissions, our focus is on  reducing energy consumption, whether in our own operations  or in the impact we have on our clients’ consumption. In 2021,  our energy consumption decreased by 12.8% from 2020. Similarly, energy intensity normalized to revenue decreased   by 13.0%. INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ENERGY    USE AND GHG To meet the company’s commitment to reducing energy   use and protecting the climate, we continue to invest in  technologies that reduce the carbon footprint of our operations  and develop technologies that help clients reduce the energy  and environmental impact of their businesses."
Xerox_275,"We will also  pursue energy reduction through the following means that  have been proven drivers in our past reduction efforts: • Manufacturing process changes; • Improved product reliability and field support strategies; • Building consolidations and facility upgrades; and • Product innovation (e.g., toners that require less energy to  manufacture and less material to achieve print quality). Beyond energy reduction, we will further reduce our GHG  emissions by employing low- and no-carbon alternatives, such  as alternative fuels for service and sales fleet vehicles and  renewable energy for Xerox operations.Energy ConsumptionMwh Mwh / $Millions of Revenue 2016 2019 2018 2017 2020 20211500000 1250000 1000000 750000 500000 250000 0110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40943,000 886,000 830,000 773,000 717,000 625,000 MWh MWh / $Millions of Revenue88 89 86 85 8910225We continually strive to expand the tracking of our GHG  emissions from our product and operations value chain, or  Scope 3 emissions. Our CSR Progress Summary includes  relevant Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 emissions  categories. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, and to make  annual data comparable, we make baseline adjustments each  year based on the opening and closing of facilities, changes to  fleet inventory, and the availability of more appropriate  emission factors. These adjustments are reflected in the Energy  Consumption and GHG emission data."
Xerox_280,"In 2022, we expanded  the boundary of its Scope 1 and 2 emission inventory, resulting  in the recalculation of previous years of GHG emissions,  including a re-baseline of our 2016 emissions. SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS In 2021, Xerox Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions totaled 133,617  metric tons of CO2e, a 43% reduction from the 2016 baseline. About 65% were direct emissions from natural gas, gasoline,  and diesel fuel combustion. The remaining 35% of the total  GHG emissions were indirect emissions from purchased  electricity and steam. Facilities owned or leased by Xerox,   such as manufacturing sites, offices, and warehouses,  contributed to 69% of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions."
Xerox_285,"The remaining 31 % are emissions from our service and sales  vehicle fleet and other mobile sources.SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS Scope 3 emissions result from Xerox activities but occur at a  third party and/or arise from sources we do not own or control. Therefore, the collection of these GHG emissions is challenging. The probability of data inaccuracy with these emission  estimates is higher than for Scope 1 or 2 emissions due to the  limited availability of data from the value chain and a lack   of transparency in the data collection process. To overcome some of these challenges, we calculate Scope 3  emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate  Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard This standard provides requirements and guidance to collect,  prepare, and publicly report a GHG inventory that includes  indirect emissions. The Scope 3 emissions information is also  used to prioritize our GHG emission reduction efforts and  integrate the consideration of carbon impact into our sourcing  and internal decision-making."
Xerox_290,"In 2021, calculated Scope 3  emissions decreased by 18% compared to 2020. Details by  category are available in the CSR Progress Summary . VERIFYING GHG   Our 2021 Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions have  been third-party verified , according to ISO 14064-3:2019, as  well as by an internally defined methodology described in   the company’s inventory management plan.Greenhouse Gas Emissions1,000 t CO2e t CO2e / $Million of Revenue22 2016 2019 2017 2020 2018 202121 20 19 21 19300 250 200 150 100 50 025 20 15 10 5 0 Scope 1 Scope 2 CO2e (Metric Tons)/$ Millions of Revenue8947 9554 10269 10983 11698 12311326ANALYZING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS    AND OPPORTUNITIES For the last two decades, we have maintained a comprehensive  GHG emissions inventory and tracking function to stay abreast  of developing external factors.

Please see the  2021 Task Force on Climate Change Related Disclosures Report   for further details."
Xerox_295,"We recognize that our business, suppliers, and clients could   be affected by more frequent disruptions because of severe  weather in the locations where we operate. We may need to  invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to aid  clients and employees affected by extreme weather  disruptions. We have experience working to ensure the continuity of critical  applications by prioritizing business needs and developing  client-specific preparedness plans, where appropriate. These  plans include communication with employees and clients,  management of employee health and safety issues, business  continuity and resumption processes, and interaction with  government organizations.27Preserving Clean Air and Water  At Xerox, we continually strive to reduce our environmental  footprint. From working toward eliminating the use of persistent,  bioaccumulative, and toxic materials throughout the supply chain  to improving process efficiency, we continue to make substantial  progress toward reducing our impact on the environment."
Xerox_300,"AIR EMISSIONS Most of our air emissions originate from the production of  imaging supplies such as toners, photoreceptor drums and  belts, and fuser rolls. Approximately 11 metric tons of volatile  organic compound (VOC) process air emissions — defined as  both VOC and non-VOC per the United States Clean Air Act —  were released into the atmosphere from these activities in  2021. Emissions in 2021 were higher than in 2020 as  production volumes began to climb from the lows in 2020 due  to COVID-19-related production declines. Over time, emission  reductions have come primarily from process modifications,  lower production volumes of legacy products, and production  declines attributable to longer-life components. A subset of these VOC emissions is defined by the United  States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as Hazardous  Air Pollutants (HAP)."
Xerox_305,"In 2021, Xerox reported worldwide air  emissions of approximately 3.6 metric tons of HAP under  national toxic chemical release regulations, including the  USEPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program. Methylene  chloride, toluene, 1,3-butadiene, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK),  and styrene constitute most of these HAP emissions.

ODSs are used as  refrigerants in facility and vehicle air conditioning systems   and various food/equipment cooling systems and comply   with applicable global regulations. The elimination of ODSs   as refrigerants is managed according to government   phase-out dates."
Xerox_310,"TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASES AND TRANSFERS   The company evaluates the disposition of materials used in our  global operations annually and reports to government agencies  under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations  such as the USEPA’s Toxic Release Inventory, the Canadian  National Pollution Release Inventory, and the European  Pollutant Release and Transfer Register. Quantities reported  through these regulations include responsible disposal and  transfers to other locations for treatment, as well as releases   to the environment. Toxic chemical releases decreased by 15% in 2021 compared  to 2020 levels and were 85% lower than 2007 levels. In 2021, approximately 2% of the total toxic chemical releases  from Xerox operations were emitted into the air. About 68% of  all chemical releases were recycled or fueled energy recovery  initiatives."
Xerox_315,"We continue to reduce our chemical usage and emissions. Methylene chloride used in the manufacture of Xerox  photoreceptor belts was decreased by 82% from the 2010  baseline primarily due to volume declines of legacy products  and process modifications that cut the amount used for batch  cleaning of production equipment. Methylene chloride usage  decreased by 7% from 2020 to 2021.2021 Worldwide HAP Emissions 63% Methylene Chloride 17% Toluene 7% 1,3–Butadiene 6% MIBK 4% Styrene 2% All othersReportable Toxic Chemical Releases and TransfersMetric Tons 2018 201998 98 202083 202171120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2021 Management of Reported Toxic Chemicals 32% Energy Recovery 36% Recycled 2% Released Onsite 2% Other Transfers 28% Treated29In 2021, Xerox was able to go end-of-life for component  manufacturing used in several legacy products. This will  enable Xerox to significantly reduce releases of higher toxicity  chemicals used in legacy materials, including 1,3-Butadiene  and Styrene. Incident-free material handling operations have  continued to maintain a reduced emission rate."
Xerox_320,"SPILLS AND ACCIDENTAL RELEASES Our goal is to proactively prevent any accidental release of  regulated materials into the air, soil, and water. In 2021, there  were zero (0) spills or releases associated with Xerox operations  that presented a significant risk to human health or the  environment or caused liabilities significant enough to be  included in company financial reports. The few spills and  releases that occurred were reported to local government  agencies as required but were not considered significant. WATER CONSUMPTION AND TREATMENT As part of our commitment to conserving resources, we monitor  water consumption used in manufacturing, distribution, and  research and development facilities worldwide. Water  consumed by Xerox operations is sourced from local municipal  suppliers that withdraw water from the ground, lakes, rivers,   or other surface waters."
Xerox_325,"After achieving our 2020 water goal, we set an aggressive new  water reduction goal to reduce water consumption by 20%   by 2030 from our 2020 baseline.In 2021, the company’s worldwide water withdrawal in our  manufacturing and research facilities was approximately   0.957 billion liters, a 3% reduction from the baseline year   2020. Water use at Xerox manufacturing and Research &  Development (R&D) sites has been trending downward   for more than a decade. Reductions were achieved by   a combination of conservation initiatives, including: • Eliminating once-through cooling systems in air compressors   at Webster, N.Y.;  • Implementing improvements to the sanitary sewer  infrastructure at the Webster, N.Y. facility (significantly reduce  groundwater infiltration into our sanitary sewer lines); and  • Recycling reverse osmosis rejects water as make-up water in  cooling towers at the Wilsonville, OR facility. Wastewater discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored  to validate compliance with local sanitary sewer discharge  limits. Process wastewater is treated, as necessary, before  being discharged into local sanitary sewers."
Xerox_330,"We utilize best practices to prevent unwanted pollutants from  entering waterways through surface contamination and runoff. Extensive sampling of wastewater discharged to sanitary and  storm sewers ensures that discharged water meets our strict  requirements. Although Xerox has not established a reduction  goal for wastewater discharges, these volumes roughly  correlate with consumption and have decreased more than  50% since 2010. Results are attributed to water conservation  initiatives, upgrades to water infrastructure, adjustments to  metered discharge estimates, and production trends.

Xerox_335,"Our aim is to design products, packaging, and supplies that  make efficient use of resources, minimize waste, reuse material  where feasible, and recycle what can’t be reused. HAZARDOUS WASTE   At Xerox, we have a mature program for reducing the amount  of hazardous waste generated throughout the company. Historically, our manufacturing operations that generate  significant quantities of hazardous waste have goals and  objectives to eliminate and/or reduce the amount of   hazardous waste. These hazardous waste reduction activities have included  manufacturing technology changes and reuse/recycling  initiatives. We strive to manage these waste streams in a  beneficial manner."
Xerox_340,"Approximately 58.1 % of the hazardous  waste generated in 2021 was managed at fuel blending and  solvent recycling facilities. Only 0.3% (1.0 ton) of hazardous  waste was landfilled; the rest generated during the year was  treated and/or incinerated. We do not export hazardous waste  to developing nations.

Xerox_345,"We also recycle  returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal  and paper. Globally, our operations generated 23,600 metric  tons of non-hazardous solid waste in 2021, a 12% increase  from 21,100 metric tons in 2020. Process waste consists primarily of paper, wood, pallets, waste  toner, plastics, and packaging waste, such as corrugated  cardboard. This waste made up 24% of the non-hazardous  solid waste managed by our operations in 2021. Equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal, waste batteries   and lamps, miscellaneous trash, and unusable, end-of-life  equipment and parts that our clients return to Xerox for  processing and remanufacturing."
Xerox_350,"We reuse or recycle nearly  100% of the equipment and parts generated from our client  and field service returns. Our goal is to reuse, recycle or recover energy from 100% of  the waste generated at facilities globally. In 2021, 95% of  non-hazardous solid waste was reused in equipment repairs or  remanufacturing, recycled, or used to produce energy, up from  92% in 2020.

We worked closely with  the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to implement  prompt measures to ensure the protection of our employees,  communities, and the environment."
Xerox_355,"Today, only two of the original 68 sites require active remedial  or control measures, and we are conducting post-remediation  compliance monitoring at four sites that are no longer subject  to active remediation. Our current focus is to work closely with  the regulators who oversee both the active and monitored sites  to identify opportunities to increase program efficiency and  accelerate the path to completion of remedial activities. We have a history of developing innovative technologies to  enhance our remedial efforts. Besides employing conventional  techniques for groundwater recovery and treatment and soil  excavation, we have also used techniques, such as high-vacuum  2-Phase Extraction and enhanced bedrock fracturing, that have  improved and accelerated the recovery of contaminants. We  utilize technologies where contaminants are degraded or  converted to less harmful substances through enhanced  natural biodegradation and chemical oxidation processes.COMPLIANCE REPORTING   We require our operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report  any written or verbal notices of environmental fines, citations,  or formal violations."

We create  opportunities for young people to pursue college degrees and,  ultimately, careers in STEM. K – 12 EDUCATION   One way for our business and communities to thrive is to  provide a means to better the lives of young people. Since the  early 1960s, Xerox and our grassroots education programs have  helped inspire young men and women to take an interest in the  STEM principles and create a career path to success — one that  eliminates poverty. A place where we’re succeeding in this endeavor is Rochester,  N.Y., where Xerox began."
Xerox_405,"The Rochester City School District has  one of the state’s and country’s lowest graduation rates and  highest poverty levels. To combat these circumstances, the  company has created a continuum of critical programming   for young students that has proven to change lives. The Xerox Science Consultant Program began in 1968 as an  effort of our founder, Joe Wilson, to have Xerox employees visit  elementary school classrooms to teach hands-on science to  children who may have never been exposed to the material or,  most importantly, a role model in the STEM field who looks like  them. In 2019, we began a partnership with the Rochester  Museum and Science Center to expand the program with the  shared goal of increasing the number of volunteers, allowing us  to reach more students in more urban districts. Throughout the  COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our work with the Science  Consultant Program via virtual lessons."

NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY Globally, we create policies that support our business goals and  reflect the culture of the countries where we do business. Xerox  does not discriminate based on race, color, religious belief,  creed, sex, age, national origin, citizenship status, marital  status, military status, union status, genetic information,  abilities, sexual orientation, or gender identity. By focusing on diversity, we at Xerox hire, promote, and retain  the best people who are well-suited for our business and reflect  the markets and communities we serve."
Xerox_480,"We’ve designed our  hiring and promotion efforts to ensure a deep, diverse pool of  talent, ready to assume leadership roles. Our efforts continue  to be guided by the Wilson Rule, named after Joseph C. Wilson,  the first CEO of modern Xerox and a champion of equal  opportunity. The Wilson Rule requires that women and minorities be among the final pool of qualified candidates for  open management and senior-level professional positions in  the U.S. Outside the US, women must be considered among the  final pool of qualified candidates for the same management  and senior-level professional positions. To further support this,  we are also working with AI vendors to increase the pool of  women and diverse candidates for our openings using their  artificial intelligence algorithms. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY Xerox is an Equal Opportunity Employer, and complies with all  applicable federal, state, and local laws that govern the hiring  and treatment of its employees."
Xerox_485,"We consider internal or  external applicants for all positions without regard to race,  color, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, gender  identity or expression, sex, marital status, sexual orientation,  physical or mental disability, use of a guide dog or service  animal, military/veteran status, citizenship status, basis of  genetic information, or any other group protected by law. For information on our supplier diversity program and  performance, please see the Supplier Relations section. RECRUITMENT As part of our ongoing commitment to building a workforce  that is diverse, inclusive, and in line with our corporate values,  we recently expanded our application of the Wilson Rule. This  internal rule requires all open management and senior- professional level positions to consider the following among  the final pool of candidates: women, minorities, veterans, or  LGBTQ+. Outside the U.S., women must be considered among  the final pool of qualified candidates for the same  management and senior-level professional positions."
Xerox_490,"A major  part of our commitment to diversity also includes accelerating  the careers of people of color and women, and we have made  progress on this through promotions and expanded roles. To  broaden our employee base, we are partnering with nonprofit  organizations, including: A Better Chance (U.S.) Black Young  Professionals (U.K.) and 7 Eagle Group (Military Veterans &  Service Members), which helps expand our sources of talent  and create a diverse workforce that better reflects the markets  and communities we serve. Attracting early career talent from different racial, ethnic, and  cultural backgrounds increases the likelihood of filling diverse  roles at all levels, sparking creative and revolutionary ideas for  years to come. In the U.K., we have the Kickstart program,  which aims to provide job opportunities for 16-24 year-olds  receiving Universal Credit. A quarter of Kickstarter participants  are women employees – in line with our focus on hiring more  women at this particular level."
Xerox_495,"At Xerox, we have created 45numerous roles across different business areas to help them  develop core skills and ready them for a successful career. We also converted eight Kickstarters to full-time staff, two   of whom are women. BOARD DIVERSITY Diversity among our board of directors is of the utmost  importance. We believe that the backgrounds and  qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should  provide a broad diversity of experience, professions, skills,  geographies, knowledge, and abilities that will allow the   board to fulfill its responsibilities. In 2021, shareholders elected ten members to the board,  resulting in 40% board diversity."
Xerox_500,"We increased the female  representation on our board of directors with the additions   of Nichelle Maynard-Elliott and Margarita Paláu-Hernández. TALENT MANAGEMENT AND WORKFORCE   DEVELOPMENT   Talent management and workforce development are critical for  the future of Xerox and for fueling business growth and  innovation. We use high-impact practices and technology to  drive global workforce capability and integrate learning with  work. Our organization and talent planning processes include reviews  with business leaders to build our talent pipeline. More broadly,  Human Resources provides a forum for management to review  the future needs of the organization, noting strengths, gaps,  and strategies to build strong teams for the next chapter at  Xerox."
Xerox_505,"During our last organization and talent planning process,  we identified critical roles and the core skills needed to perform  those roles. We also identified additional baseline skills  required for all Xerox roles and are implementing learning  pathways to support employees in obtaining and maintaining  those skills. We utilize a third-party, online learning platform  that is available to all Xerox employees for self-directed  learning and helps to support skill and career growth. The company is also committed to accelerating the careers of  high-potential and diverse employees. Vista, our high-potential  development program for early-career talent, is in its second  year."
Xerox_510,"This is a one-year development and acceleration program  for our highest-potential employees across the globe,  sponsored by the Executive Committee, designed to provide  enhanced visibility, special assignments, and skill development. This program also includes individualized career coaching,  mentorship, and networking opportunities with Executive  Committee and Senior Leadership members, which helps to  accelerate our talent pipeline, retain early talent, and increase  engagement. GLOBAL LEARNING INNOVATION FOR EMPLOYEES   AND PARTNERS   The world of work has changed. From hybrid working to  accelerating digital transformation, we have been focused on  preparing our employees and clients for this change. From an employee perspective, this includes identifying  technologies that can bridge the skills gaps and enable  employees to leverage digitally-enabled solutions."
Xerox_515,"For example,  CareAR™, an enterprise augmented reality business that offers  live virtual assistance technology, is a disruptive technology  that is modernizing field service, customer support, and other  IT services, as well as helping reduce skills gaps. Our Learning and Development (L&D) function has also been  using different forms of digital technology to train and reskill  employees in the flow of work. Expanding digital learning will  enable both partners and employees across the globe to learn  at the point of need. Our employees also have access to a global learning platform,  Percipio, that includes thousands of targeted online courses,  virtual classroom events, simulations, job aids, and other  learning and development resources. Topics include critical  job-specific information and technical upskilling, management  development and professional effectiveness, productivity tools  for project management, ethics, diversity and inclusion, and  information security."
Xerox_520,"We also provide access to Industry  certifications. Learning history is tracked online and available for employees  and partners to include in their professional portfolios. We also  provide resources for Xerox proprietary certifications,  instructor-facilitated classes, virtual hands-on labs (vHOLs), and  on-the-job experience. TOTAL REWARDS: COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS   Our success depends on attracting and sustaining a healthy  and productive global workforce. Globally, we provide our  people with a comprehensive Total Rewards program that  includes various compensation, benefits, and work-life  programs."
Xerox_525,"Our programs are designed to achieve the following objectives: • Drive shareholder value:  Support our business strategy   and culture; • Align with performance: Align our people’s interests with our  shareholders, thus incentivizing the right behaviors; and • Support our talent strategy: Attract, retain, and motivate   a productive workforce.46As with most global companies, our compensation and benefits  vary by location based on employee eligibility, local practices,  and regulations. We benchmark our programs to ensure that we  know our competitive position amongst our peers and the  markets we serve, while maintaining alignment with our  short-term and long-term business goals. As a result, we review  annually and make changes to our compensation and benefits  programs to achieve our objectives. Our compensation  offerings may include the following, depending on eligibility:  base pay, short-term incentive bonus, and long-term incentive  pay. Our benefit offerings provide our employees with choice  and flexibility to help them reach their health and financial  goals."
Xerox_530,"Representative offerings include the following programs:  healthcare, wellness, retirement, paid time off, life and  disability, and voluntary benefits. Performance, both at the individual and company level,  matters. We have an integrated Performance Management  and Compensation strategy and process that drives our desired  cultural behaviors, business results, and high performance. This key company process touches nearly every one of our  people globally, helping them achieve their stated objectives  and earn appropriate rewards. Ultimately, we believe that when  the company performs well, we all benefit — in the form of  development opportunities as well as greater compensation."
Xerox_535,"EMPLOYEE SAFETYWe at Xerox are committed to maintaining a safe work  environment for our people. We have a worldwide incident  reporting process in place that helps track and monitor our  safety performance. This, in combination with workplace safety  inspections, and hazard analysis, helps focus our improvement  efforts on areas where we can have the greatest effect on  preventing incidents and where populations are most at risk. Workplace accidents and near misses are investigated, and  trends on root causes are obtained. Our system for recording  and characterizing root causes of accidents was modified to  further improve our injury analysis and reporting."
Xerox_540,"Employee  safety communications take a variety of forms, given the great  diversity in our operations and workplaces. Several methods are  used to raise employee safety awareness, including site-specific  hazard management, off-the-job safety information, and  communications regarding unique safety concerns endemic   to the geography. We strive toward a goal of zero workplace injuries, continually  decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries every year. In 2021, our U.S. total recordable injury (TRI) rate decreased by  23%, and our day away from work case (DAFW) rate decreased  by 6% from 2020-levels. Likewise, our worldwide operations  successfully reduced injury rates with a 24% decrease in TRI  and a 5% decrease in DAFW cases."
Xerox_545,"Overall, this improvement  trend has continued for several years and is the result of  increased safety awareness and communication to our  employees and focused safety management processes   within our management teams. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our  priority has been the health and safety of our  employees, clients, partners, and their families. We continue to monitor developments around  the world and maintain a robust set of  protocols to keep the entire Xerox community  safe while minimizing the impact on operations  during this public emergency. In April 2021, we returned employees to   offices where legally permissible. Our ability   to safely do so is the result of the careful  implementation of protocols guided by science  and public health agency guidance."
Xerox_550,"As  government requirements evolve and case  rates fluctuate in different geographies, we  continue to adjust our protocols accordingly.Injury Rate U.S. Only (injuries per 200k work hours) 2017 2018 2019 2020 20212 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 Total Recordable Injury Rate Day Away from Work Case Rate Note: The data does not include any COVID-19 positive cases  that may have occurred.47SAFE FACILITIES To ensure that all Xerox-owned and leased facilities meet our  stringent fire and life safety requirements, all real estate  transactions are reviewed by the EHS&S organization before  being occupied. Xerox fire safety and life safety requirements  have been established and implemented worldwide, regardless  of location, size of the facility, or occupancy classification. The  focus of the safety review is life safety requirements, including  safe egress in an emergency, fire and incident prevention, early  detection, suppression, occupant notification, and prompt  emergency response. These reviews also ensure that building- specific emergency plans are implemented and updated, and  that emergency drills are completed at least annually. ASSET PROTECTION AND FIRE SAFETY The Xerox Asset Protection and Fire Safety Program provides  fire-safe workplaces and limits potential losses to company  equipment and property from fire, explosions, and natural  hazards such as windstorms, snow-loading collapse, and floods."
Xerox_555,"The program includes periodic inspections and mitigation  planning for all unacceptable risks. Review meetings of  locations audited are conducted regularly with our corporate  risk management team and our loss control engineering  supplier to establish strategies that reduce the risk of losses. Our philosophy is to consistently hold our higher-value locations  to a “Highly Protected Risk” standard. In addition, locations are  reviewed for conformance to Xerox standards and recognized  fire, property, and life safety standards. We continue to  demonstrate excellent loss control performance and benefit  from favorable insurance rates and premiums."
Xerox_560,"CONTRACTOR SAFETY PROCESS The Contractor Safety Program at Xerox aims to ensure that  contracted work conforms to all applicable regulations and  company environment, health, and safety (EHS) requirements. Contractors are qualified to meet the safety and health  requirements before beginning work at a Xerox location. Based  on the complexity and potential safety hazards of the  contracted work, contractors are required to submit a job  safety plan. All workers at U.S. Xerox sites must attend a safety orientation  session and complete the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration’s (OSHA) 10-hour safety course when  appropriate to the job function. Incidents and injuries are  tracked both as feedback to the contractor and to measure  program effectiveness."
Xerox_565,"First established in our Webster, N.Y.,  operations, this model has been applied successfully in many  of our larger locations.The company also functions as a contractor for many client  accounts. At these sites, we follow our internal safety  standards, establish worker protection plans, deliver specific  employee training, and maintain management oversight to  ensure that our operations meet both Xerox and client  requirements. ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EH&S)   PROJECT REVIEWS   At Xerox, we continually make modifications to our facilities,  work processes and operations to improve safety, efficiency,  and effectiveness. To ensure these changes meet our  applicable safety standards, regulatory requirements, and  good management practices, projects are reviewed by  occupational safety and health professionals. The scope of the  project is defined, potential safety and environmental impacts  are characterized, and control requirements are established  and communicated before the project is initiated."
Xerox_570,"The process  serves to inform the engineering and management teams of  safety requirements and ensures that all project designs have  controls integrated into the work plans. The process ensures  environmental, health, and safety requirements are understood  and implemented at the beginning of each project. Examples  include capital improvements to facilities, manufacturing, and  R&D areas. In addition, assessments of the health and safety hazards of  new product technologies undergoing R&D are performed. Recommendations are made on the design and  implementation of controls to ensure employee safety (e.g.,  laser safety of medium- and high-powered lasers, local exhaust  ventilation systems, and personal protective equipment)."
Xerox_575,"CORPORATE EH&S COMPLIANCE AUDIT PROGRAM   A well-established internal audit program measures our success  in implementing corporate standards, allows us to share best  practices, validates regulatory compliance, and evaluates risk  management processes. Corporate assessments at significant  locations are conducted once every three to five years based  on the inherent risks associated with site operations. These  risks are re-evaluated on a regular basis and include site size  and type of operation, specific EH&S regulatory applicability,  and employee turnover. Xerox audit teams evaluate operations against our internal  standards, external regulations, and industry guidelines. When  necessary, we also focus on a particular EH&S aspect based on  technologies with unique hazards and evaluate management  system performance."
Xerox_580,"With the assistance of local managers  and support staff, action plans are developed and deficiencies  corrected.48Senior management is included on all final reports and/or  corrective action plans resulting from the assessment, enabling  immediate attention to issues with the potential to pose a  significant risk of environmental damage, serious injury to  employees, or regulatory noncompliance. The company’s audit  program is an important mechanism for identifying and  correcting performance gaps. COMPLIANCE REPORT Our workplaces continue to have strong safety and health  compliance performance. Xerox Corporation had zero OSHA  citations and penalties in 2021. However, a wholly owned  subsidiary of Xerox did have an extensive OSHA compliance  audit at one of their locations, resulting in ten deficiencies  identified and two citations issued with a total penalty of  $9,720."
Xerox_585,"The deficiencies were largely administrative in nature,  relating to documentation, postings, etc. The two citations  involved hazard communication and personal protective  equipment. All deficiencies were abated immediately. In  addition, Xerox EHS&S conducted a comprehensive safety  assessment of all similar operations to ensure any compliance  deficiencies were promptly identified and abated. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Because emergencies and disasters often strike without  warning, we established an emergency preparedness and  response program to help protect the safety of our employees,  surrounding communities, and the environment."
Xerox_590,"To prepare for emergencies, we have implemented site-specific  Emergency Action Plans in our facilities, globally, to assist with  the execution of appropriate actions in response to local  emergencies. Our plans account for common emergencies such  as fires, weather-related emergencies such as tornadoes and  hurricanes, and location-specific emergencies such as  earthquakes and radiological emergencies. These plans also  include shelter-in-place procedures to protect our employees  from emergency situations that occur outside of our facilities. We utilize a mobile risk communications platform that enables  two-way communication between our employees and Xerox  Corporate Security. The application lets us provide support by  allowing people to communicate with our security team during  an emergency and check-in to mark themselves safe if a crisis  hits."
Xerox_595,"We also include resources and procedures for first aid medical  response in the event of an injury to or illness of an employee  in our facilities. In our more complex and higher hazard  operations, we have Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs). These MERT employees are provided with the training  and equipment necessary to render a quick response to  stabilize the emergency until more advanced medical support  arrives. In addition to emergency action plans established at the local  operation level, there are preparedness plans at the corporate  level including major incident response, crisis management,  and pandemic preparedness. These plans are designed with a  central corporate strategy that utilizes an incident command  structure."
Xerox_600,"Incident response managers are responsible for local/ regional tactical and emergency response, coordinating efforts  at their respective locations with the Corporate Crisis  Management Team, and dealing with local business operations  issues. Response coordination and integration are a part of the  planning process. All preparedness plans are routinely tested for effectiveness  through management reviews, corporate audits, and annual  drills. Any discrepancies are noted and corrective actions  implemented. Following an emergency, business resumption  plans are put into action to ensure that operations are quickly  restored."
Xerox_605,"WORKPLACE HEALTH MANAGEMENT Our workplace health programs include processes for  emergency medical response, the characterization of employee  fitness for duty, and pre-employment drug testing. Programs  are also in place for conducting medical exams in connection  with safety-sensitive work as well as drug testing and  immunizations based upon specific work operations and client  accounts. PREVENTING AND MONITORING WORKPLACE   EXPOSURE   To protect Xerox employees from unsafe exposure to chemicals,  noise, and radiation, we apply exposure limits to worldwide  manufacturing, research, and technology service operations  based upon the threshold limit values (TLV) recommended by  the American Conference of Governmental Industrial  Hygienists. These reflect the best advice of a widely respected  committee of international experts. However, in jurisdictions  where government regulations are more stringent, Xerox meets  those regulatory requirements."
Xerox_610,"For some materials, including  toners, certain solvents, and metals, the company has  established exposure limits that are more stringent than the  TLV or existing regulations and standards.49• Office ergonomics:  Our largest employee population is  office-based. Raising awareness and helping employees make  effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for  this population. We created computer-based training on  ergonomic principles and practices, enabling employees to go  through the required training programs at a time that minimizes  business interruptions. This group also faced a significant  challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic when their workplace  transitioned to their homes. Our ergonomics team developed  simple, practical instructions on how to modify common home  areas into computer-based workstations, making the transition  from working at the office to working at home a seamless one."
Xerox_615,MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY   Motor vehicle safety is a key component of our safety  initiatives at Xerox. We have a company car program that  includes motor vehicle safety requirements for our drivers and  accident prevention and reporting processes. Employee driving  records are reviewed on a regular basis and remedial motor  vehicle safety training is provided to improve awareness and  competency. Motor vehicle accidents are tracked by frequency  and type and reported to the management team. A comprehensive safety review is conducted on any vehicle  model before it is accepted as part of the company’s fleet.
Xerox_620,"We  review the safety ratings and crash test results of candidate  vehicles and require safety features such as daytime running  lights and safety barriers between the driver’s seat and storage  areas. We also encourage feedback from our fleet drivers to  assess vehicles in use so that, moving forward, we can make  better informed selections.Using the Xerox Exposure Assessment process, industrial  hygienists, and safety professionals monitor, assess, and report  workplace exposure. Effective process design, engineering  controls, safe job procedures, and personal protective  equipment are utilized to control exposure and protect  employee health. Medical surveillance programs are in place   to monitor the health of employees working in operations with  specific jobs and hazards (e.g., high noise, organic solvents). The results of those medical exams are reviewed by healthcare  professionals to ensure employee health."
Xerox_625,"Of the workplace  exposure monitored in 2021, 100% were below these more  stringent limits. When necessary, employee inhalation and  noise exposure were controlled through the proper use of  hearing protection and respiratory protective equipment   where additional engineering controls were not feasible. ERGONOMICS As musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant portion of  our work-related injuries, we work to minimize the risk factors as  a job is designed. We also study exposure to ergonomic hazards  and raise awareness with employees so that they can make  improvements to their workstations. From manufacturing operations to office work, we continue to  study the causes and potential remedies for workplace injuries."
Xerox_630,"A few brief highlights are mentioned below: • Manufacturing operations:  Each operating unit is required to  complete an Action Limit Checklist for all jobs. This checklist  helps identify areas of ergonomic risk and prioritize necessary  changes/modifications. All employees are required to have basic  ergonomic training that includes identifying risk factors,  common injuries related to poor setup, and simple strategies for  improvement. • Machine service: We have studied Xerox Technical Service  Representatives’ (TSRs’) exposure to ergonomic hazards. The  findings have helped the company select tools and develop  procedures to mitigate the risk of musculoskeletal disorders."
Xerox_635,"When designing new equipment, evaluations are done to assess  risks for our TSRs. The best time to make a modification is when  a product is still in the design or early test phases.50Employee Rights At Xerox, we protect the fundamental rights of our employees   and respect the laws and customs of the countries where we   do business. We recognize that our employees are our greatest asset. We continually strive to provide all our employees with a   safe workplace, free from all forms of harassment and  discrimination. We have global policies and practices to ensure  the highest ethical standards."
Xerox_640,"All our employees are to be  treated fairly and equitably regardless of nationality, religion,  ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, language, or any other  protected status. At Xerox, we have a long-standing commitment to conducting  business with integrity. In fact, the company was named one   of Newsweek’s America’s Most Responsible Companies in 2021. Our corporate Business Ethics and Compliance program was  established in 2001 and designed to foster the highest ethical  standards among employees and those working on our behalf. It also aims to prevent, detect, and address potential violations  of the Xerox Code of Business Ethics, associated company  policies, and applicable laws and regulations."
Xerox_645,"CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT Our Code of Business Conduct is the bedrock of our ethics   and compliance program. It embodies and reinforces our  commitment to integrity and helps our people resolve related  concerns in a manner consistent with our core values and legal  and policy controls. Our Code of Business Conduct is available  in 19 languages and accessible through our internal and  external websites. It is aligned to our core values and covers  policies and guidance on key topics, including sales and  marketing activities, controllership, insider trading, bribery,  nondiscriminatory employment practices, privacy rights,  human rights, and environmental stewardship. The Code also  specifies employees’ obligations to report suspected ethical  violations and reinforces our strong no retaliation policy."
Xerox_650,"We promote communications and awareness of our ethics and  compliance program on the company’s Ethics & Policies website  and in company intranet postings. Periodic ethics surveys are  conducted on employees in several countries to gauge the  state of the ethical culture at Xerox and help us focus on areas  for improvement.Many of our employees are represented by labor unions, trade  unions, or work councils throughout our global operations. Relationships with these groups are based on applicable laws   in each country. In Europe, we recognize a variety of work councils and trade  unions as established under European labor laws to meet the  requirements for information and consultation for the  protection of employee rights. The following countries have  100% union representation: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,  Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and  Switzerland."
Xerox_655,"Union representation in Latin American countries includes  Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico and ranges from   50–100%. The CSR Progress Summary includes a detailed  breakdown by country. In the U.S. and Canada, we maintain a cooperative and  effective relationship with three unions that represent nearly  3% of employees in five locations: Workers United, Unifor,   and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) through  a cooperative agreement with Workers United. OPERATIONAL CHANGES TO COLLECTIVE   AGREEMENTS   In the U.S., the notification periods required for operational  changes are specified in collective bargaining agreements and  vary depending on the location and type of change. As a  default, each agreement contains a duration clause, which  provides that if either party desires to make changes to the  agreement before its termination, written notice must be given  60 days before the expiration date."
Xerox_660,"GRIEVANCE PROCESSES Each collective bargaining agreement in the U.S and Canada  includes a provision allowing for unions to file grievances. The  number of steps in the grievance process, however, depends on  each collective bargaining agreement, with the final step being  binding arbitration.51EMPLOYEE ENGAGMENT As we continue to work together to strengthen our business,   we are equally committed to evolving our culture to reflect our  shared values, who we are, and what is important to us as an  organization. Open dialogue has always been a priority at Xerox, and we   are committed to fostering open communication between  employees and management — from one-on-one conversations  to company-wide activities. This year, through a leadership  engagement tour, digital focus groups, and roundtable  discussion, we are emphasizing reconnecting, sharing, and  listening because this will help us better understand what is  working well and where we have opportunities to improve. To reinforce a company-wide culture of belonging, we are  continuing to host “All of Us Together” events and listening  sessions to help facilitate an ongoing dialogue about how to  create more diversity and inclusion in the company and the  communities in which we live."
Xerox_665,"Our employee engagement goal is to tap into the knowledge,  creativity, and enthusiasm of our people — at all levels — who  care deeply about our great company. 52Client Health and Safety The health and safety of our employees, workplaces, and clients  is of paramount importance. Compliance is the foundation of   our effort. We evaluate all potential health and safety hazards,  including the ways different hazards may interact. Furthermore,   we take a conservative position on the potential health risks to our  employees and clients, always meeting or exceeding government  safety regulations."

Clients can access PSDS and SDS in different languages. Xerox was the first and remains the only company in our  industry to have concluded two comprehensive investigations  that lasted more than three decades on the health risks of  inhaling xerographic toner. These studies included assessments  of the health of current employees and the causes of death for  people who worked for the company between 1960 and 1982. The analysis demonstrated that the health and mortality  patterns of Xerox employees were consistent with a healthy  working population, and, in fact, our employees had a lower  rate of disease than the general population."
Xerox_700,"In October 2010,  the mortality study was published in the peer-reviewed Journal  of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. C O M P L I A N C E  At Xerox, compliance is the minimum standard we set for  ourselves. We have robust processes for tracking regulatory  violations and nonconformity with voluntary codes and labels. In 2021, no such instances resulted in fines or sanctions. We  also have a comprehensive process in place for tracking client  concerns and other field events."
Xerox_705,"All client issues, such as  incidents involving component failures and other potential  safety concerns, are investigated carefully to determine the  root cause and monitored for trends. Corrective actions are  implemented as necessary. ERGONOMICS We consider the ergonomic aspects of our products from   both a user and service standpoint to ensure inclusion and  operability. Our design teams consider all points of human  interface, including a product’s height, curves, and the  placement of touchscreens and paper trays. We also place  a high value on the end-user experience through human  factors, industrial design, and user interface design to promote  ease of use, ease of learning, and transfer of learning."
Xerox_710,"Product  design teams work directly with clients in our labs to test and  continually improve the usability of new products. ACCESSIBILITY AND MOBILITY Our focus on increased mobility has expanded with the  anywhere, everywhere, and always-on enterprise. We’re  enabling businesses to manage their complex infrastructure   for a flexible workforce, using a combination of organization- provided and personal devices, while working with the same  expectation of a seamless, secure ability to find, create, use,  and print business documents.

By listening  to our clients, we develop meaningful relationships and  quantifiable analytics to continuously improve our programs  and processes. RELATIONSHIP PROCESSES As a part of our account management process, we have three  distinct processes and activities to ensure the health of our  client accounts: internal contract reviews (ICR), renewal forums,  and quarterly business reviews (QBRs). Each of these business  processes has dashboards for performance reviews at a  summary and detail level. In ICRs, service delivery managers and client managers meet  on a quarterly basis and review client business and  organizational changes, as well as issues and opportunities  within each account."
Xerox_730,"Changes to client organization and  business objectives are discussed and roles are assigned. Issues  and opportunities are identified, actioned, categorized, and  summarized by topic and region. This allows the company to  respond as needed as well as understand and identify  emerging issues and opportunities for central support. Through  this feedback, the account team can take specific, local action  and leverage global programs to ensure a strong client  relationship and better performance. Renewal forums are planned eight quarters prior to contract  expiration and bring together all functional areas that provide  value to understand the client experience."
Xerox_735,"Each functional area  reviews and actions customer feedback. Through this process,  we can ensure cross-functional alignment to meet client needs  in the current contract and respond to new opportunities to  meet their objectives. Lastly, we conduct formal QBRs with clients. In these sessions,  we provide performance information, seek feedback, and  discuss business challenges and opportunities aligned to their  needs. At the conclusion of each QBR, we offer the client a  web-based pulse relationship survey."
Xerox_740,"The survey asks for  feedback scored in five areas: QBR quality, innovation,  relationship strength, overall satisfaction, and willingness to  recommend. Each is measured on a one to ten-point subjective  scale. When received, specific QBR feedback is provided to the  account team. A summary performance is reviewed within each  region and assessed to determine common opportunities  across clients.TRANSACTIONAL SURVEYS Xerox conducts three types of transactional surveys: • The first is a contact center transactional survey for voice call  and chat feedback, primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and  Africa (EMEA). Clients are asked to provide feedback on the call  process, agent performance, quality of the solution offered, and  overall satisfaction."
Xerox_745,Results are used to provide feedback to the  contact center. • The second are technical service surveys within the U.S.  mid-market and U.K. region. These surveys are sent to clients  via a web link and assess client satisfaction with on-site service  events. This feedback is provided to local technical service  teams to understand service call quality. • Account-specific event surveys are also available using the  Sentinel Customer Assurance System.
Xerox_750,"Surveys can be  customized to receive short-term or long-term feedback on  certain service elements. Sentinel includes web-based “sense  and respond” features for clients to easily raise unresolved  issues or share feedback that is immediately routed to the  appropriate Xerox staff for closed-loop management. The  power of Sentinel is in the ability to test specific client feedback  within a given environment. Given the broad adoption of  Sentinel by clients across the globe, we are modernizing our  communication methods to enable quicker client feedback. Sentinel also generates a Sentinel Net Experience Score, used   to track and manage overall client experience."
Xerox_755,"Collection and  response to client feedback is addressed at multiple levels   with full accountability by the business. TRACKING CLIENT SATISFACTION As highlighted above, feedback is collected from multiple client  touchpoints and with relationship and transactional surveys. Each element is used for specific client action to improve  performance and relationship. They are also categorized and  understood to help identify emerging issues and opportunities  to modify processes within a region or globally. This allows a  comprehensive view and response that client-facing teams at  Xerox can leverage to improve performance."
Xerox_760,"Feedback is  directed to the appropriate organization to drive pervasive  improvements with the client experience, including product  and services quality and capability, sales relationship and  engagement, service and support practices, and progressive  collaboration on social and digital platforms. Each organization  manages the flow through of client feedback, with  accountability to report on critical client satisfaction factors.55Additionally, we offer our clients access to the Xerox Sentinel  Client Satisfaction Assurance System, which is a proprietary  closed-loop client experience system. Sentinel includes  web-based “sense and respond” features for clients to easily  raise unresolved issues or share feedback that is immediately  routed to the appropriate staff for closed-loop management.

Xerox_795,"Security functionality is integrated at the individual device  level and extends seamlessly to the fleet. State-of-the-art  encryption is used to protect client information, both while   it’s at rest in the device and in motion to and from the device. Security guides are available on xerox.com for specific   devices, which explain in detail what security controls can   be configured; this is a representative example for the   Xerox 8100 Series . User authentication is used to grant access to Xerox® Printers  and Multifunction Printers (MFPs) for walkup and network  users. Once authenticated, the user can interact with the  device, subject to the restrictions of their role."
Xerox_800,"Our printers and  MFPs employ a variety of technologies to ensure only those  authorized can access device features and functions. This  includes: • Network authentication;  • Unlocking from a mobile phone with near-field communications  (NFC) technology; and • Card swipe methods connected to Microsoft Active Directory,  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication,  role-based access control, and smart card authentication  methods. A variety of security features are also used to protect Xerox®  Devices from malicious attacks. For instance, the Xerox®  AltaLink® 8100 Series uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM)  hardware chips to store encrypted keys keeping them secure  from cyber-attacks. The AltaLink® 8100 Series also utilizes the  Trusted Boot feature that protects the device from malicious  activity at startup by engaging in a series of system checks   and verifications to validate each step of the process and  preventing the startup from being compromised, right up   to the loading of the system firm.In addition, the Xerox® AltaLink® and VersaLink® Printers run a  comprehensive firmware verification test either at start-up or  when activated by authorized users."
Xerox_805,"This alerts users if any  harmful changes to their printer have been detected. Our most  advanced solutions use Trellix whitelist technology, which  constantly monitors for and automatically prevents any  malicious malware from running. Integration with Cisco  Identity Services Engine (ISE) auto-detects Xerox® Devices on  the network and classifies them as printers for security policy  implementation and compliance. The latest AltaLink devices now include Security Information  and Event Management (SIEM) firmware support for  connections to Trellix Enterprise Security Manager, LogRhythm,  and Splunk. The SIEM feature enables the device to send  security events directly to compatible SIEM systems using the  syslog protocol."
Xerox_810,"Xerox® CentreWare® Web (CWW) and Xerox® Device Manager  (XDM) management tools provide security features such as  automated firmware downloads, security settings monitoring  and remediation, and security performance reporting. All of  these can be managed remotely. For smaller fleets, the  embedded Fleet Orchestrator feature in AltaLink provides a  secure, server-less fleet management by using a hub and spoke  method to deploy software and configuration updates  automatically. We have also enhanced the security of Solid-State Drive (SSD)  technology with the addition of the ‘Job Data Removal’ feature  available on Xerox® AltaLink B8100 and C8100 Series devices. When initiated, this feature can delete either temporary files  (associated with normal print, scan, and fax operations) using  the ‘standard’ setting, or temporary files and those specifically  stored for later use (e.g., Print with Saved Job type, Scan to  Mailbox, Fax Mailbox, etc.)."
Xerox_815,"Additionally, we put special emphasis on the care and handling  of machines that are returned to us after lease expiration or  otherwise. Hard disks in these devices are destroyed or  completely remastered to remove any residual client  information before they are reused. Xerox® Managed Print Services helps clients manage their  printer and data security with a focus on four key measures:  device security, fleet management, document management,  and data/content management. Xerox® Workplace Cloud   and Suite software applications provide comprehensive  authentication, accounting, and authorization as well   as content security solutions.57 According to the 2022 Quocirca Managed Print Services (MPS)  Landscape Report, “Xerox is one of the most established MPS  vendors in the market, with the broadest capabilities across   the cloud, digital workflow, security, and analytics. Although it  particularly stands out for its multivendor approach, a strong  differentiator is its Xerox® ConnectKey® Technology platform,  which enables businesses to drive productivity and efficiencies  across their document processes."

SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT The Xerox supplier code of conduct and compliance program  are the primary tools we use to instill improved social,  environmental, and ethical governance practices in our   supply chain, as warranted. In 2008, the company joined the Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA), formerly known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship  Coalition (EICC), to strengthen our approach for managing  corporate social responsibility across the supply chain. All RBA members are accountable to a common code of  conduct for social, environmental, and governance of its  operations and suppliers."
Xerox_830,"We have adopted the RBA Code   of Conduct as our Supplier Code of Conduct. The company enforces the code by including terms and  conditions in our supplier purchase agreements and contracts  and requiring suppliers to represent and warrant their  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the   sale of goods/materials to Xerox. We perform risk assessments  and require suppliers to participate in the Xerox Compliance  Program. Annually, we remind our suppliers of their contractual  obligations.An initial risk assessment is conducted to determine which  suppliers pose higher corporate social responsibility risks. Suppliers classified as high-risk and those considered critical to  our supply chain are required to complete a Self-Assessment  Questionnaire (SAQ) annually."
Xerox_835,"If significant risks are indicated  on the SAQ, then we will schedule an audit of that supplier. The SAQ also serves to raise suppliers’ awareness about the  importance of social responsibility topics, clarify our  expectations, target areas for review, and document suppliers’  assessment of their performance. Annually and based on the  assessments and questionnaires from the previous year, we  select suppliers for compliance review or an on-site audit. In 2021, 25 of our major suppliers completed SAQs where 24  suppliers were found to be low-risk with one being medium-risk. There were no high-risk suppliers identified.2021 Supplier Spend by Region 0% Asia 35% Europe 63% North America 2% DMOFY 2021 Supplier Spend – $4.0B 19% Acquired Products 43% Indirect 27% Production 11% Transportation Name of Company Sustainability Site Sustainability Report FUJIFILM Business Innovation FUJIFILM CSR 2021 Sustainability Report  Nittsu Shoji Co.

If a supplier  is found to have violated applicable laws or contract terms and  conditions, the company reviews each situation on a case-by- case basis and determines the necessary course of action (e.g.,  terminate supplier relationship, instruct supplier to take  corrective action.) BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND REVIEWS We review suppliers’ performance against expectations and  contractual requirements, prioritizing them based on business  risk and revenue impact. Suppliers with the highest business  risk and potential revenue impact are considered critical and  are required to maintain an acceptable business resumption  plan. We inspect these plans on a regular basis.Revenue risk criteria include: • Materiality risk to business revenues; • Annual supplier spends and total contracted value of the full  relationship; • Impact to product life cycle management; and • Extent of the impact to related subsystems and product  portfolio."
Xerox_845,"Business risk criteria include: • If a supplier is a single source; • Length of time to resume business after an adverse event; • Percentage of revenue that Xerox represents to the supplier; • Financial stability of the industry and the supplier; and • Probability and severity regarding natural disasters, climate  change impacts, and/or political turmoil.

For audits conducted in  2021, the company used the latest ratified RBA Code of  Conduct (version 7.0) that included additional requirements  pertaining to social and environmental dimensions. CONFLICT MINERALS We are committed to improving mining conditions associated  with sourcing goods and materials containing conflict minerals,  e.g., tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold. The company maintains a  Conflict Minerals Policy and publishes due diligence activities  in our annual SEC Conflict Minerals Report. Our internal  processes incorporate the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) framework for Responsible  Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk  Areas."
Xerox_855,"We are an active member of the RBA and the Responsible  Minerals Initiative (RMI). We use the RMI Conflict Mineral  Reporting Template (CMRT) to survey our supplier base  regarding conflict-free mineral usage. We also support the  Responsible Mineral Audit Program (RMAP), which  independently audits smelters and refiners to determine if they  have a system in place to ensure the compliant sourcing of  conflict-free minerals. Our supplier contract template includes  a specific reference to conflict-free minerals to ensure  responsible sourcing in our supply chain. The company has conducted an analysis of our products and  found that, although we do not directly purchase conflict  minerals from our suppliers, we purchase products, component  parts, and materials that contain metals, some of which have  conflict minerals."
Xerox_860,"We work with our tier 1 suppliers to provide information on the  origin of the conflict minerals contained in components that  are included in our products by using the CMRT. This enables us  to perform our Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI). We complete analysis of the information and continually work  with suppliers to improve compliance within the supply chain. Based on the information provided by our suppliers and  Responsible Minerals Initiative, the smelters and countries of  origin of the 3TG minerals contained in our products include  those listed in our annual Conflict Minerals Report . SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY The Xerox brand is known worldwide for delivering industry- leading document technology, services, and solutions."
Xerox_865,"Counterfeit parts and supplies misrepresent the quality of our  products and pose a serious threat to our reputation. Read our  Anti-Counterfeiting Statement . At Xerox, we have rigorous processes to identify and eliminate  counterfeit supplies and components from our supply chain. Through these processes, we: • Microchip customer-replaceable unit module (CRUM) to protect  genuine Xerox® Supplies for use with Xerox® Products; • Source from trusted established suppliers and their authorized  distributors who have been through our comprehensive vetting  system; • Seek warranties guaranteeing authenticity and quality; • Require that suppliers seek approval from our Global  Procurement and Engineering groups if they want to substitute  a different item from what was originally agreed upon; • Built security controls into our supply chain to help ensure the  uninterrupted flow of products, from the point of manufacture  to the client; • Monitor 100% of our direct and critical indirect suppliers to  ensure compliance with global anti-bribery laws and  regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act; • Are certified participants of the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism; • Are members of (C-TPAT) and the E.U."

SUPPLIER DIVERSITY We proactively identify and seek to work with certified small  and diverse businesses, and several independent groups have  recognized Xerox as having outstanding supplier diversity."
Xerox_875,"A diverse supplier pool is a competitive advantage and   a powerful business tool. We are committed to: • Actively seeking certified diverse suppliers that can provide  competitive, high-quality goods and services and whose  business models align with our strategy; • Ensuring the inclusion of diverse suppliers as part of our  strategic sourcing and procurement process; • Communicating the value of supplier diversity both internally  and externally to all stakeholders; and • Leveraging our supplier diversity results to meet our clients’  supplier diversity requirements. Supplier diversity adds value to the supply chain and increases  our competitive position. Xerox is rich in culture from our global  workforce, clients, shareholders, and suppliers. We know that  these initiatives give us our competitive advantage and help   us maintain our leadership position.We take part in several efforts with the goal of increasing  diversity and inclusion in different business areas."
Xerox_880,"For instance,  we are an active member of the New York/New Jersey National  Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the  Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. We participate  in various national and regional conferences, matchmaker  events, and forums, which promote business with small, diverse  businesses.

Xerox_885,"Xerox Corporate  Governance Guidelines have been adopted by the board of  directors of Xerox Holdings Corporation. These Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect the board’s  commitment to monitor the effectiveness of policy and  decision making, both at the board and management level to  enhance long-term shareholder value. These Guidelines are  reviewed by the board, through the Corporate Governance  Committee, on an annual basis. They are subject to  modification from time to time by the board, acting by a  majority of the independent directors as determined under the  Corporate Governance Guidelines. Waivers of these Guidelines  may be made by the board or the Corporate Governance  Committee only."
Xerox_890,"The board’s responsibility is to monitor the effectiveness of  management policies and decisions, including creating and  executing its strategies with a view to enhance long-term  shareholder value. The board is also responsible for overseeing  the establishment and enforcement of procedures designed to  ensure that our management and employees operate in a legal  and ethically responsible manner. INDEPENDENCE OF THE BOARD   The board comprises a substantial majority of directors who  qualify as independent directors, including an independent  chairman. The company’s board of directors is 87.4%  independent. The board determines each director’s  independence, broadly considering all relevant facts and  circumstances, and has adopted categorical standards to help  it make the determination."
Xerox_895,"Under these standards, to be  presumed independent, a director shall not have a material  relationship with Xerox or its consolidated subsidiaries. BOARD MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA The ultimate responsibility for the selection of new directors  resides with the board. The Corporate Governance Committee  reviews candidates for election as directors and annually  recommends a slate of directors for approval by the board and  election by the shareholders.The board requires that a substantial majority of its members  consist of independent directors. Any management  representation should be limited to top Xerox management. Nominees for director are selected based on, among other  things, broad perspective, integrity, independence of judgment,  experience, expertise, diversity, ability to make independent  analytical inquiries, understanding the company’s business  environment, and a willingness to devote adequate time and  effort to board responsibilities."
Xerox_900,"Members should represent a  predominance of business backgrounds and bring various  experiences and perspectives to the board. The Board requires  that the initial list of candidates from which new management- supported director nominees are chosen by the Corporate  Governance Committee should include, but not be limited to,  qualified women and minority candidates. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also dictate that  diversity should be considered by the Corporate Governance  Committee in the director identification and nomination  process. Although the board does not establish specific goals  with respect to diversity, the board’s overall diversity is a  significant consideration in the director nomination process. This means that the Corporate Governance Committee seeks  nominees who bring a variety of business backgrounds,  experiences, and perspectives to the board."
Xerox_905,"Bylaws, committee charters, and our Corporate Governance  Guidelines  are available on xerox.com. In 2021, we included  ESG in the compensation criteria for Executives. These cover  climate change, a balanced workforce, and workplace safety. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE AND COUNCIL   The Corporate Governance Committee of the board of  directors has oversight of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The Committee reviews significant shareholder relations issues  and environmental and CSR matters, ensuring our actions align  with our core values and citizenship priorities."
Xerox_910,"The CSR Council,  comprised of senior executives managing a specific CSR topic Governance64area, has centralized oversight of the corporation’s  management approach, including policies, goals, strategies,  and actions to drive progress. Each Council Member is  supported by individuals who have expertise and experience in  the various CSR topic areas. An individual from the Executive  Committee of the CEO chairs the Council to provide direction  and guidance. The primary mission of the CSR Council is to  drive strategies with a client-centric impact across Xerox  globally to advance our legacy of leadership in corporate  citizenship. Actions taken must meet our stakeholders’  expectations, including clients, employees, investors,  regulators, and communities worldwide."
Xerox_915,"In 1946, CEO Joseph   C. Wilson established our core values that have stood the   test of time and align with the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs). We will continue our efforts to  bring our operations and those of our clients closer to goal  achievement. RISK MANAGEMENT With global leadership comes global responsibility to our  people, shareholders, suppliers, distributors, and the citizens   of the countries where we operate. That’s why we devote  considerable resources toward Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM), anticipating and mitigating risks to our business’  financial and operational health. ERM follows a clearly defined business strategy shared across  the company and aligned with our strategic and organizational  goals."
Xerox_920,"Our ERM process is based on the COSO II (Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission)  framework. We assess business risk based on the chance of  failing to attain our strategic objectives. Steering committee  members meet monthly to assess emerging risks, risk appetite  and occurrence probability. The committee also monitors  action plans put in place to mitigate risk at the enterprise level. ERM assessments are coordinated with our Internal Audit Risk  Assessment to ensure consistency between the ERM plans and  upcoming internal audits."
Xerox_925,"We have integrated consideration for  climate change-related risks and opportunities into its ERM  Process.Several executive committees integrate ERM with business  management by monitoring both risk exposure and how  effectively those risks are managed. These committees include: • Management Committee; • Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee; • Business Ethics and Compliance Governance Board; • IT Risk Governance Board; • Credit Committee; • Currency Strategy Committee; • Reputation Management Committee; and • Management Audit Committees. In addition, the Audit Committee of the board of directors   has a vital role in ERM oversight, while the roles of other  committees, including Compensation, Governance, and  Finance, are restricted in scope. As needed, the board will  establish special committees to focus on specific business risks.65Xerox Policies and Standards Assuming a leadership role in sustainability requires a focused  approach to drive the greatest value to our stakeholders and  company. We use a materiality assessment to prioritize our  activities."
Xerox_930,"Corporate policies are statements outlining requirements  to be followed by all Xerox organizations falling within their scope. Corporate staff and their designated functional experts are  responsible for determining the need and content of policies   in their respective functional areas and coordinate policy  development with affected operating units and other corporate  staff functions. Since each employee of Xerox contributes to the overall  reputation of the company, it is critical that each employee  understands their important role, and the policies and  procedures applicable to them, while maintaining high  standards of legal and ethical conduct. Corporate policies and  procedures pertaining to CSR are summarized in our Code of  Business Conduct. All employees can readily access the global  Code of Business Conduct and all corporate policies on the  Xerox Office of Business Ethics intranet site."
Xerox_935,"Employees are  required to annually certify compliance with the Code of  Business Conduct. Standards are the means to implement our policies and guide  employees and suppliers in complying with corporate policies. These worldwide principles, such as those for the environment,  health, and safety, apply across Xerox and establish specific  requirements for products, services, and operations.TRACKING OF EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS The Office of Global Government Affairs at Xerox is responsible  for tracking external developments, including climate change  policy, and determining if they are likely to affect our products  and operations. Through trade associations and partnerships,  EHS&S tracks applicable regulations and policy changes that  may affect the company or our partners. We develop  processes, technologies, and products to counter risks  associated with external changes."
Xerox_940,"Our major operating units  and key corporate functions (e.g., Risk Management and Real  Estate) are also responsible for evaluating, monitoring, and  managing specific risks within their respective businesses that  could potentially affect the company’s ability to achieve its  overall objectives. The Business Continuity Assurance Process  ensures that operating units are prepared for business  disruption risks.66Engaging with our Stakeholders Regular engagement with our stakeholders ensures we are  positioned to serve them and their communities. Xerox  stakeholders include employees, clients, public policymakers,  investors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), remanufacture  and recycling vendors, suppliers, and global communities. Business  units and operations across the company gather input from  stakeholders about corporate social responsibility pertaining to our  products, operations, and how we may positively affect the world. The engagement may take the form of partnerships, sponsorships,  collaboration on industry initiatives, client reviews, supplier audits,  or conference participation."
Xerox_945,"The Xerox Corporate Social  Responsibility Council uses this information to ensure we  implement a comprehensive CSR strategy. Stakeholder engagement provides essential inputs to our  materiality assessment and our company business strategy. With this information, we prioritize issues and emerging risks  and understand opportunities. At Xerox, we believe that  prioritizing stakeholder concerns enables us to develop a  strategy that is robust, inclusive, and satisfies stakeholder  needs. In 2022, we conducted a refresh of our matrix and  intend to complete a full assessment in 2023."
Xerox_950,"Examples of stakeholder engagement for our most material  CSR priorities include: • Stakeholder satisfaction: At Xerox, we conduct extensive,  proactive investor outreach to facilitate candid discussions  about our business and strategy. In 2021, the company hosted  19 calls with 11 different investors who were engaged and  provided feedback about ESG reporting metrics, diversity, and  executive compensation practices. The feedback provided  valuable insights to the senior leadership team and helped  inform our CSR corporate goal setting. On February 23, 2022,  we hosted Investors Day with financial analysis and investors   to discuss business solutions and financial services that make  everyday work better for our clients. Disruptive innovation  technologies were also displayed including digital  transformation, augmented reality, and robotic process  automation to name a few.• Data security:  The company works with compliance testing  organizations and security industry leaders such as McAfee   and Cisco to wrap their overarching standards and expertise  around ours."
Xerox_955,"As a result, we achieve top levels of compliance. Certification bodies, such as Common Criteria (ISO/ IEC 15408)  and FIPS 140-2, measure our performance against international  standards. The company was the first provider in the industry to  achieve FedRAMP certification for cloud-based MPS. Our MPS  offering meets security requirements set by the U.K.’s Ministry  of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense. • Product energy efficiency:  We share our leading practices  across the industry by contributing to standards development  that affects product sustainability such as ENERGY STAR and  EPEAT."
Xerox_960,"We work closely with EPA, ENERGY STAR, and EPEAT,  providing input for the development of future standards. • Supply chain responsibility: As a member of the Responsible  Business Alliance (RBA), we join other companies to drive  improvements in global supply chains. See the Supplier  Relations section for additional details.67• Circular economy: As a founding member of the Sustainable  Electronics Recycling International (SERI), we collaborate to  drive progress for the global reduction, recycling, and reuse of  materials and parts of end-of-life electronics in an energy- efficient manner and with socially sound practices.

Xerox_965,"• Client satisfaction: To ensure we maintain a pulse on the client  experience and continue to deliver client excellence, we have   a number of established client-focused processes. Through   the company’s account management process, nearly 900  systematic internal and client-facing business reviews are  conducted quarterly across Xerox globally. These reviews are  designed to align the company’s actions and processes to client  feedback and business goals, ensure strong relationships, and  achieve client business objectives. Additionally, feedback from  over 50,000 touch points with SMB customers are collected  each month. Feedback from these reviews and touchpoints   is captured, organized by business objective, and used to  determine account-specific and programmatic activities to  improve operational, finance, and relationship performance and  goals."
Xerox_970,"These reviews culminate in a pulse relationship survey,  used to further refine client communication and programs. Additionally, client councils are semi-annual, multi-day events  held to directly solicit Voice of the Client input and feedback for  current experience and future strategies. A varied set of clients  meet with regional leadership to discuss their relationship with  Xerox, emerging business trends and innovation opportunities  in our shared business space. This year, a new Client Experience  leader was named to create an organization in the Americas,  focused on ensuring an exceptional experience throughout the  entire client journey.• Employee engagement:  Our people are a critical link between  the company and society. For more than three decades,  thousands of our employees have participated in the Xerox  Community Involvement Program (XCIP)."

Our long-term  goal is to support a sustainable paper cycle and minimize  environmental effects while meeting our clients’ business  needs. At Xerox, we sell paper in our developing market geographies. We apply stringent paper sourcing guidelines for companies  that provide paper to Xerox for resale. The requirements cover  all aspects of papermaking from forest management to the  production of finished goods."
Xerox_1000,"We supply paper that complies  with sustainable forest management practices or standards,  including the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Program for  the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). FSC-certified  papers use raw materials from an FSC-certified source,  controlled wood sources, or post-consumer reclaimed sources.The company helps reforest some of the world’s most treasured  ecosystems by maintaining biodiversity and combating  deforestation. For clients leveraging Xerox® Intelligent  Workplace Services, we provide them with an opportunity to  opt in to our PrintReleaf partnership, which is akin to a carbon  offset program. We leverage paper usage reporting that  equates the number of trees needed to reforest that usage   on an equivalent basis in geographic areas of need. The  company helps clients select the managed forestry projects  where their trees will be planted in addition to tracking and  reporting on their direct reforestation impact."
Xerox_1005,"Since launching this program in 2018, Xerox and its clients have  reforested more than three hundred thousand trees across the  world, from the Amazon to Madagascar, offsetting more than  two and a half billion pages.

This year’s  World Environment Day celebrated the continuation of the   UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, a global mission to revive  billions of hectares, from forests to farmlands. The Arbor Day  Foundation is the largest member nonprofit organization  dedicated to planting trees and, in partnership with supporters  from around the world, it has planted nearly 500 million trees. We partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to meaningfully  contribute to this global restoration effort and educate  employees on how they can make a difference in both big   and small ways."

Following the pollinator garden certification  process of the Master Gardener program, employees also  installed a birdbath, bee condo, and butterfly house to provide  water and shelter to pollinators. Pollinators play an important  role in stabilizing an ecosystem and this garden serves to  support them and highlight their importance to the public. Similar gardens were created in Washington, D.C. and Toronto,  Canada. ETHICS, INTEGRITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS At Xerox, we understand our obligation to play a larger role in  society."
Xerox_1015,"We lead by example, encouraging respect for human  rights in our own company and through our business  relationships. Every employee engagement, partner affiliation,  and client touchpoint represent an opportunity for us to  exercise our commitment to human rights. Our Code of Business Conduct supports the principles of the  United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A  corporate-wide global policy letter serves as the foundation   of our position on human rights. We make sure that those  standards are followed in our labor relations and employment  practices, relationships with suppliers, risk management,  internal audit systems, and our approach to building business  in emerging markets."
Xerox_1020,"Each year, our employees are required   to take a refresher training course and acknowledge their  conformance with the Xerox Code of Business Conduct. Xerox is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA),  an organization that promotes a standards-based process for  monitoring the social responsibility of suppliers. Through the  RBA, we further our commitment to human rights in such areas  as labor, health, safety, and environmental activity. We also manage a comprehensive data privacy program. We take utmost care to preserve and protect the personally  identifiable information of both clients and employees."
Xerox_1025,"BANK NOTE ANTI-COUNTERFEITING The risk of document counterfeiting is more prevalent as the  quality of digital imaging tools and color printing technology  grows. We support the use of appropriate anti-counterfeiting  technologies and continuously cooperate with appropriate  government and law enforcement agencies worldwide, when  and if required, to assess and address such threats.72INITIATIVES TO COUNTERACT PIRACY AND FRAUD   The company is leading the charge against counterfeiting   and other illicit market activities, both independently and  collaboratively with other original equipment manufacturers. Every year, the global imaging industry — and the clients who  use its products and services — suffer the loss of millions of  dollars due to piracy and fraud. At Xerox, we are vigilant in our  efforts to thwart both the use of our brand on counterfeit  materials as well as “blending,” whereby counterfeit materials  are mixed with the originals. The use of counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment  performance, low supply yields, inferior print quality, toner  leakage, increased failure rates, and equipment downtime – all  of which can cost time and money."
Xerox_1030,"To avoid this risk, we advise  our clients to purchase solely from Xerox or an authorized Xerox  channel partner. PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT Participation in the political and public policy processes is   vital to our business at Xerox, serves the best interests of our  shareholders, employees, others in our industry, and the  broader business community, and is a necessary component   of good corporate citizenship. We pursue our public policy  objectives with integrity, responsibility, and in full compliance  with all laws. The Xerox Of fice of Global Government Affairs coordinates and  oversees all policy-based interactions with governments and  governmental organizations across the nation and around the  world. The issues we engage in are many; however, we have a  few top advocacy areas where we focus our discussions with  policymakers in the United States: INTERNATIONAL TRADE   At Xerox, we support open markets and rules-based trade  among nations."
Xerox_1035,"Policies that create a level playing field for  international trade are significant drivers of economic growth,  opportunity, employment, and innovation, both in the U.S.   and globally. We support intergovernmental dialogue and  negotiation aimed at increasing certainty for cross-border  trade, including cross-border data flows and increasing market  access opportunities, including for information technology  products and services. Open markets offer important  opportunities to showcase our products, services, and business  solutions to new clients. At the same time, we believe that all  market participants must be responsible citizens of the  countries in which they do business.CORPORATE TAXATION   Xerox Corporation is committed to complying with all tax   laws at the federal, state, local, and international levels and  ensuring that it pays the correct amount of taxes owed to each  authority whose tax laws govern its activity. In addition, it is  committed to dealing with the various tax authorities in a  transparent manner, using best practices to determine its legal  obligations under the applicable tax laws and regulations."

EDUCATION The company has had a long-standing tradition of supporting  efforts aimed at ensuring American students graduating from  high school and college have the necessary skills to compete in  the workforce. We are particularly passionate about programs  that further American students’ access to science, technology,  engineering, and math (STEM) curricula. These efforts help   us to recruit and retain a skilled workforce, and allow us to  compete globally. We have worked with Congress and several  Administrations to reform higher education programs,  vocational education funding, and K–12 standards."
Xerox_1045,"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY At Xerox, we actively support global policies and practices that  combat theft of intellectual property by counterfeiters who  manufacture knockoff products. Further, we oppose frivolous  intellectual property litigation that imposes unnecessary costs  on innovative companies. As a result of the U.S. Congress  undertaking a serious examination of U.S. patent laws, we are  undertaking a review of our own patent policy priorities. This  will help enhance the company’s ability to innovate, protect,  and monetize our intellectual property and seek reforms that  would permit disputes to be adjudicated, based on their legal  merits rather than litigation economics. ENVIRONMENT   Our Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability  Governance Policy  adopted in 1991 forms the foundation of  our environmental leadership program."

The Office of Global  Government Affairs has an established network of resources  whose responsibilities include monitoring legislation and  policies that would affect our various government lines of  business. RETIREMENT POLICY We believe policymakers should foster a legal and economic  framework that encourages employers to provide high-quality  retirement security options to their employees. We take our  commitment to our employees, both current and retired, very  seriously, and our Office of Global Government Affairs works  closely with the U.S. Congress and the Administration to  formulate policies that help us meet this obligation. HEALTHCARE At Xerox, we advocate for policies that allow for sustainable,  high-quality healthcare systems that are more accessible, less  costly, and more patient-centered."

We do not discriminate in favor of or against employees  based on the organizations they choose to support. Employees  are not reimbursed directly or through increases in  compensation for their personal political contributions   and expenses. XEROX POLITICAL CONTRIBTUIONS   We have a long-standing policy that nothing of value may   be given, paid, promised, or offered — directly or indirectly — from corporate treasury funds for any of the following: political  party, committee, and/or candidate for any federal, state,   or local government office anywhere around the world;  independent expenditure or ballot measure committees;  electioneering communications; or candidates for judicial  office. Xerox Corporation Political Action Committee (XPAC) The only authorized method to make political contributions   on behalf of Xerox is through the Xerox Corporation Political  Action Committee (XPAC), which is funded solely with voluntary  employee contributions."
Xerox_1070,"Every proposed political contribution must be legally  permissible and in the best interests of Xerox and its  shareholders. We use several guiding principles when selecting  which candidates or committees receive XPAC political  contributions. Although no single issue or criterion determines  whether a candidate or committee receives a contribution,   we consider: • The integrity and character of the candidate; • The candidate’s position on significant policy issues of  importance to our company; • The candidate’s overall support for our company and industry; • The candidate’s overall support for the free enterprise system  and U.S. competitiveness; • A demonstrated willingness on the part of the candidate to  work with our company and industry to achieve responsible  public policy solutions;• The candidate’s representation of a state or district in which our  company has a significant number of employees or facilities; • Whether the candidate holds a leadership position within their  political party; and • The candidate’s electability permissible under applicable law. XPAC also focuses on contributions that go directly to  candidates for office. Special exceptions are required for  contributions out-of-election-cycles and contributions to  leadership PACs, trade association PACs, ballot measure  committees, and political parties."
Xerox_1075,"XPAC does not permit in-kind political contributions or  contributions for independent expenditure committees,  electioneering communications, candidates for judicial office,  and presidential candidates. XPAC Oversight The Corporate Governance Committee of the Xerox Board   of Directors is responsible for oversight of XPAC’s political  contributions and receives regular reports on XPAC activities. XPAC is led by a Board of Trustees, which includes a cross- section of managers from Xerox who represent their unique  business unit and geographic areas. A Contributions  Committee appointed by the XPAC Chairman and consisting   of three members is responsible for selecting, by majority vote,  the candidates to receive a contribution from XPAC. The Vice  President of Global Government Affairs, Sustainability, and  Citizenship serves as the XPAC Treasurer and oversees all  spending.75 XPAC 2021 Contributions XPAC discloses all contributions made and received on reports  filed with the Federal Election Commission  and the various  state and local campaign finance commissions as required by  law."
Xerox_1080,"In accordance with XPAC’s Articles of Organization, an  audit of the accounting books of the XPAC is performed at  least once during every two-year election cycle to ensure  compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971,   as amended, its regulations, and all other applicable laws.

It is an integral part  of the way we do business. Our business ethics and compliance  programs are designed and implemented to ensure that Xerox  employees and all those working on behalf of the company follow  the highest ethical standards. The program aims to prevent, detect,  and address potential violations of our Code of Business Ethics   and its policies, applicable laws, and regulations. OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE The Office of Compliance oversees and coordinates the work   of the company’s subject matter experts to ensure that we are  in full statutory compliance with global rules and regulations  related to all applicable laws in our industry as well as internal  policies."
Xerox_1090,"The Office of Compliance also collaborates with other  departments such as internal audit, corporate security, legal,  human resources, government affairs, and ethics to ensure  sustainable corporate compliance. The Office of Compliance is managed by the Compliance  Leader who reports to the vice president, Global Government  Affairs, Sustainability, Citizenship and Compliance, and the  Chief Legal Officer. The compliance leader acts as a liaison  between the company and external, independent audit and  compliance companies and contractors and advises and makes  recommendations to the Office of General Counsel and  management team regarding the state of statutory compliance  at the company. The compliance leader prepares quarterly  compliance updates for executive management and the board  of directors. The Chief Legal Officer reports directly to the   Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xerox."
Xerox_1095,"In 2022, the Office of Compliance worked with senior leaders  to bring together a formal compliance network to champion  compliance within the company, encourage a positive culture  of compliance, encourage reporting of allegations of non- compliance, share best practices and areas of improvement,  and assist in prioritizing improvement projects and resources. The formal compliance network is a cross-functional group comprised of individuals from various organizations and  business units. Initial priorities for the compliance network  included identifying core compliance training and discussing  best practices related to corporate policy management. COMPLIANCE RISK ASSESSMENT At Xerox, we conduct periodic compliance risk assessments  based on a format used by the Institute of Internal Audits   and use 70 criteria provided in the U.S. Department of Justice  guidelines, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC),   and the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). These  compliance risk assessments are intended to: • Assess the design and operation of the company’s corporate  compliance programs, considering governmental expectations,  existing/changing legal requirements, and leading practices; • Provide observations, risks, and recommendations including: • Identifying existing elements and gaps in the compliance  infrastructure; • Identifying and prioritizing opportunities to enhance the  company’s compliance program; • Establishing a baseline for compliance monitoring and  continuous improvement; and • Ensure sustainable corporate compliance processes by  implementing corrective actions that meet statutory  requirements and balance ideal performance factors   and resources.77Assessment topics include, but are not limited to, general  corporate compliance, sexual harassment, data security,  foreign corrupt practice, third-party risk management and  information privacy."
Xerox_1100,"The assessment results help to identify  areas of improvement and proposed action items, which are  then presented to senior management for review and decision,  followed by implementation plans. BUSINESS ETHICS OFFICE Each Xerox employee and those working on behalf of the  company have an important role to play, not only in helping   us succeed but also in how we achieve that success. Doing  business following the highest ethical standards and in  accordance with the Xerox Code of Business Conduct, company  policies, and applicable laws and regulations are at the heart  of what Xerox is as a company. Since its inception, we have recognized that the best possible  results for our clients, shareholders, and communities can only  be delivered when conducting ourselves ethically and with  integrity. It’s a part of who we are and how we do things."
Xerox_1105,"The Xerox Business Ethics Office oversees our efforts to  reinforce and enhance the company’s culture of ethics and  compliance on behalf of operating unit management,  corporate management, and the Audit Committee of the Xerox  board of directors. The Senior Manager of the Ethics Office  manages the day-to-day operations of the Ethics Office and  reports to the Xerox Chief Ethics Officer, who reports to the  Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer, and Chief  Legal Counsel with a dotted-line reporting relationship to the  Audit Committee. MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT AND OVERSIGHT At Xerox, we are committed to fostering a culture of ethics and  compliance with the law at all levels of the company. The Ethics  Office conducts ethics and compliance programs and activities  under the authority of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees and approves the Xerox annual  ethics and compliance program."
Xerox_1110,"It also receives and reviews  potential ethics issues as identified by the Chief Ethics Officer. The Xerox Business Ethics Office maintains metrics to help  detect misconduct and inform continuous improvement of the  ethics program. The Business Ethics Office also prepares  quarterly reports for the company’s external auditors and the  Audit Committee of the Xerox board of directors. The Chief  Ethics Officer attends Audit Committee meetings and prepares  reports on the status of the Ethics program, including metrics,  program strategy, and operations updates. CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND POLICIES Our Code of Business Conduct serves as the foundation of our  Business Ethics and Compliance Program."
Xerox_1115,"It embodies and  reinforces our commitment to integrity and helps us resolve  ethics and compliance concerns in a manner consistent with  our core values and legal and policy controls. Our Code of  Business Conduct is available in 19 languages and accessible  on our internal and external websites . The Code is aligned to  our core values and covers policies and guidance on key topics,  including sales and marketing activities, controllership, insider  trading, bribery, non-discriminatory employment practices,  privacy rights, human rights, and environmental stewardship. It also specifies employees’ obligations to report suspected  ethical violations and reinforces our strong non-retaliation  policy, which is also supported in a separate, stand-alone  corporate policy. We have a comprehensive framework of policies that  incorporates a culture of compliance into day-to-day  operations."
Xerox_1120,"Corporate policies are published on the Xerox Ethics  & Policies intranet. Additionally, key policy references are  included in the Code of Business Conduct to help ensure  accessibility. The company’s Business Ethics Policy is publicly  available and translated into 19 languages. It describes the  ethical conduct required when conducting business on the  company’s behalf or representing Xerox in any capacity. Country-specific and regional policies exist to provide  additional clarity."
Xerox_1125,"In addition to our global Code of Business Conduct and policy  framework, we have a supplemental Finance Code of Conduct  for finance employees and a Code of Business Conduct   and Ethics for the board of directors. As a member of the  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we us the RBA Code   of Conduct as our supplier code of conduct. COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING At the start of every year, the Xerox Chief Executive Officer  distributes a message on business ethics to employees. All  employees, including those working on behalf of Xerox, must  complete ethics training annually and acknowledge that they  have read the Code of Business Conduct. New hires are  required to complete foundational ethics training."
Xerox_1130,"We also  require employees at certain levels and in certain functions to  complete anti-corruption training on an annual basis. All  employees are also required to complete harassment training. Xerox continually assesses its compliance training program and  identifies areas of training focus based on risk, job grade, and  job function. 78The Xerox senior leadership team is required to complete   a conflict-of-interest disclosure and ethics certification,  confirming that each is in compliance with our Code of  Business Conduct, have processes in place to support the  company’s Business Ethics and Compliance Program, are  committed to protecting those who make good faith reports   of an actual or suspected violation from retaliation, and will  work to safeguard the confidentiality of investigations. We promote awareness of our Business Ethics and Compliance  Program on our Ethics and Policies intranet site and Ethics   and Compliance Program website ."
Xerox_1135,"We participate in internal  speaking engagements to enhance employee understanding   of the program and incorporate real-world examples of ethics  and compliance dilemmas in our communications to keep  ethics and compliance front and center for employees and  those working on behalf of Xerox. We periodically implement   a global ethics survey across the organization to measure the  state of the company’s ethical culture and help us focus on  areas for improvement. BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE GOVERNANCE   BOARD The Xerox Business Ethics and Compliance Governance Board  (Governance Board) works closely with the Ethics Office to  imbed business ethics into the company’s worldwide business  operations. The Ethics Office coordinates the Governance  Board’s activities to ensure consistency and provide an  executive-level forum for discussing emerging trends, issues,  and concerns. Board members are appointed by Xerox senior  leadership and required to complete an annual ethics  certification, memorializing their commitment to their  responsibilities."
Xerox_1140,"The Governance Board represents business   and corporate organizations within Xerox and its subsidiaries  and participates in quarterly meetings chaired by our Business  Ethics Office. Members are responsible for establishing regional  and/or local networks within their respective organizations   to promote and make certain that a culture of ethics and  compliance exists globally at Xerox. REPORTING, NON-RETALIATION, AND   INVESTIGATIONS   At Xerox, we promote a culture where it is safe to speak-up,   free from retaliation. We provide a variety of channels for  employees, suppliers, and clients to report suspected ethical  violations, including phone, web, email, and postal mail. The Xerox Ethics Helpline  is available globally 24 hours a   day, seven days a week, in multiple languages, via toll-free  telephone numbers and our web reporting tool, which supports  multiple languages."
Xerox_1145,"We have contracted with an independent  third-party that specializes in helpline reporting with  immediate electronic transfer of all reports to our Business  Ethics and Compliance Office for triage and oversight and  monitoring of ethics allegation cases. We have a strong, stand-alone non-retaliation policy. The  company prohibits retaliation against any employee who raises  or makes a good faith report alleging a potential violation of  the Xerox Code of Business Conduct, Xerox policies, or any law  or regulation regardless of whether the report is determined   to be founded or unfounded following an investigation. Retaliation in response to a good faith report is not tolerated. For some cases, the Business Ethics Office provides guidance  and takes immediate action; for others, including allegations   of wrongdoing, an ethics investigation is required."
Xerox_1150,"The office  follows a formal, consistent method for assessing alleged  violations and complaints and directs them to the appropriate  functional areas for investigation, resolution, and closure. Our Business Ethics Office Charter includes a “Worldwide  Assignment of Responsibility Matrix for Handling Potential  Ethics Violations and Associated Penalty Guidelines.” This   tool includes a wide range of possible ethics and compliance  violations within each category of our Code of Business  Conduct. The company has established policies, guidelines, and  collaterals on conducting internal ethics investigations and  periodically provides training to investigators. The goal of our  internal investigations is to ensure that they are independent,  objective, thorough, effective, properly documented, and  completed in a timely fashion. Appropriate actions are taken   in response to investigative findings and the root cause of   any violations are addressed to prevent a recurrence of issues."
Xerox_1155,"Ethics allegation matters substantiated, in whole or in part,  result in disciplinary action (counseling, training, warning letter,  job reassignment, financial penalty, or in some cases, dismissal  from the company). In addition to disciplinary action, the  resolution of many cases may also involve changes in processes  or policies to prevent future occurrences.79Matters Peported   to the Ethics Office2019 2020 2021 Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Accounting and Financial  Improprietiesi23 9% 11 3% 6 2% Business Integrityii49 19% 37 10% 37 11% HR, Diversity and Workplace  Respectiii95 36% 107 28% 93 29% Misuse, Misappropriation   of Assetsiv8 3% 6 2% 15 5% Safety and Securityv17 6% 29 8% 48 15% General Informationvi45 17% 160 42% 104 32% Othervii27 10% 30 8% 20 6% Total Number of Matters 264 100% 380 100% 323 100% i  Accounting and Financial Improprieties  Financial improprieties, improper accounting practices, and insider trading. ii  Business Integrity  Antitrust, bribery, conflict of interest, data privacy, disclosure of confidential information, fraud, gifts, improper payments,   and regulatory compliance. iii  HR, Diversity and Workplace Respect  Discrimination, harassment, retaliation, compensation, leave of absence, accommodation, work environment, and other   HR-related matters iv  Misuse, Misappropriation of Assets  Misuse of company information, issue on timekeeping, or inaccurate expense reporting and theft. v  Safety and Security  Safety violations, unsafe acts or unsafe conditions, work-place violence/verbal abuse and potential substance abuse."

ANTI-CORRUPTION, EXPORT CONTROLS, AND   SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE   It is the policy of Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries to  comply fully with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption  (ABAC) laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act (UKBA)."
Xerox_1165,"Similarly,  we are committed to complying fully with applicable export  controls and sanctions restrictions. The company operates an active and comprehensive ABAC  compliance program, supported by policy and annual training  overseen by the Business Ethics Office in the Office of General  Counsel. We prohibit the giving or offering of a bribe of any  amount or value. This includes small “facilitation” or “grease”  payments for routine government approvals and actions unless  employee security and health are at risk and even then, only  with prior approval. We screen potential clients for applicable export control  requirements and sanctions restrictions, drawing on an internal  network of export control coordinators and subject matter  experts."
Xerox_1170,"We also conduct risk assessments of third-party  intermediaries and include a contractual obligation that  requires third-party intermediaries to adhere to the same  standards for compliance with ABAC, export controls, and  sanctions. The company sends an annual reminder letter to its  major distributors and resellers outside the U.S., requiring them  to acknowledge and confirm awareness of the FCPA, UKBA,  and all locally applicable ABAC laws and regulations, as well as  any applicable export controls and sanctions. This third party  must also certify that, to the best of its knowledge, it has  complied fully with these requirements.81How We Report In this report, we identify our process for prioritizing corporate  social responsibility (CSR) topics that are relevant to our  stakeholders and business. For our most material priorities, we  include a description of our management approach, including  policies and programs from Xerox through August 2022 unless  otherwise noted. We also share the methods we use to evaluate  our effectiveness in managing these topics."
Xerox_1175,"This often includes  internal and external feedback we have received throughout the  year. With this feedback and changing external dynamics, we  modify our approach. We are a performance-based, data-driven company in all   areas, including CSR. We set goals, engage with stakeholders,  join initiatives to make an impact, and track our progress. In  this report, we share this information."
Xerox_1180,"Throughout the year,   we communicate updates on xerox.com and our social media  accounts, external speaking opportunities with trade  associations, industry consortiums, and executive client  engagements. This report is in accordance with the core reporting  requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  Standards. The table linking the content of this report to the  GRI Standards can be found below. Much of the information   in this report reflects the activities of Xerox in the countries  where we do business. Some of our systems for collecting and  reporting reliable social and environmental data, however, are  for select operations."
Xerox_1185,"We identify operations excluded from  specific disclosures wherever appropriate. Environmental   data in this report is normalized to our financial performance  utilizing company revenues, as reported using Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Mark Schneider Chief Executive OfficerClimate change actions can take time to take effect but,  even as our company has grown and revenues increased,  we are seeing a reduction in emissions. We have passed  ‘peak carbon’ and decoupled our emissions from growth,  charting an even more sustainable future for our company. Human rights play a key role in enabling a just transition  to regenerative food systems. In December 2021, we  released our new Human Rights Framework and Roadmap."
Nestle_5,"Through implementing this framework, and with  powerful collaborations, we will enhance due diligence  and develop action plans to address our most salient  human rights issues. Advancing regenerative food systems at scale is the only  path forward for meeting people’s nutritional needs as  the world’s population grows. Consumers also feel this  urgency. We have continued to respond to consumer  demand and do our part for the planet by developing  products that deliver great taste and nutritional value   while minimizing their environmental impact.

Now, EY has also provided independent assurance   of selected key performance indicators (KPIs), as shown   in the performance summary on the following page   and indicated throughout the report."
Nestle_15,"We know we cannot achieve our goals alone. When we  work together, we can accelerate the just transition at the  same time as protecting, renewing, and restoring the planet  and ensuring food systems can continue to nourish people  for generations to come.We continued to accelerate our sustainability efforts in 2021,  even though the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was another  challenging year. Keeping our people safe and ensuring  consumers have access to our foods and beverages has  remained central to Nestlé’s activities around the world. Climate change is increasingly impacting the farmers  and communities with whom we work. The degradation  of forests, land, soil, and waterways threatens farmers’  livelihoods and jeopardizes the availability and affordability  of quality food."
Nestle_20,"Building on our Net Zero Roadmap, we are  taking action to help address these threats by advancing  regenerative food systems at scale. Evolving farming practices to protect and enhance  ecosystems while regenerating the land is essential,  though this transition will only be fair and just if we put  people first. With this in mind, we are offering farmers  technical, scientific, and financial support to begin adopting  regenerative agriculture practices, to reward them for both  quality ingredients and environmental benefits. To accelerate the transformation towards net zero  emissions and equitable, regenerative food systems, we  are delivering on our commitment to invest CHF 1.2 billion  by 2025 in regenerative agriculture practices and have  committed to sourcing 50 percent of our key ingredients  through such methods by 2030. This will contribute to  achieving our ambition to halve our greenhouse gas  emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050."
Nestle_25,"We also continue our work to eliminate deforestation   in our primary meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, soya   and sugar supply chains by 2022. By 2025, we aim to  achieve the same for our coffee and cocoa supply chains. Over the last 10 years, we have worked hard to assess  and address the risks of deforestation together with our  partners and suppliers, as well as directly with farmers   and farming communities.

Nestle_50,"We have sought to build our business  approach on decisions that are not just good   for us and our shareholders, but for society   and the planet as well. In September 2021, we announced our intention  to advance regenerative food systems at scale. This means supporting the development of food  systems that protect, renew and restore the  environment, improve the livelihoods of farmers  and enhance the resilience and well-being of  farming communities. This is what we mean  by a just transition. Farmers and communities  should be supported through this change and  benefit from it."
Nestle_55,"Our commitments on regenerative agriculture,  farmer livelihoods and child labor risks, as well  as our Forest Positive strategy  and Nestlé Waters  pledge are good examples of the potential to  positively impact a wide range of interconnected  issues, while remaining firmly grounded in a  metric-driven, outcome-focused approach.

Here’s why Regenerative agriculture  could be the answer Paul Hawken, Founder, Project  Regeneration and Author, Regeneration,  Ending the Climate Crisis in One  Generation, and special advisor to Nestlé  The initiative to regenerate food systems worldwide  places Nestlé at the forefront of corporate leadership. As the world’s largest food company, Nestlé faces  extraordinary challenges in the years and decades to come."
Nestle_60,"These relate directly to the production and creation of food  by farmers, some of whom have been suppliers to Nestlé  for five generations. Farmers are dealing with increasingly  disruptive weather – drought, floods, heat, and wind – impacts that can easily tip farmers’ harvests from gain to  loss. These impacts and more will increase in magnitude   as weather patterns continue to become more erratic. “Regenerative food systems are not aspirational, they  are pragmatic. They benefit the entire supply chain, the  whole of the company, and all of global society."
Nestle_65,"The food  and agriculture sector together is the largest contributor  to global warming. At the same time, the growing and  production of nutritious food is the greatest contributor   to human health and well-being. The adoption of  regenerative agricultural techniques harmonizes these  seemingly opposing issues into one initiative. “Soil is a community, not a commodity. Regenerative food  systems create biologically rich and healthy soils."
Nestle_70,"Healthier  soils sequester and store significant amounts of carbon,  and can substantially reduce global greenhouse gas  emissions. Carbon-rich soils create strong and vigorous  plants that are more nutritious. Biologically rich soils hold  10 to 20 times more water than conventionally farmed  Rob Cameron, Global Head of Public  Affairs and ESG Engagement, Nestlé  With a history of over 150 years, Nestlé has always taken  the long-term view. For decades, we have applied ourselves to  creating shared value wherever we operate and have strived  to be a force for good. But as we examine the world today and  look to the future, it is clear that profound change is required."
Nestle_75,"“The food systems of which we are a part have delivered  great benefits to the world and withstood great shocks –  not least in recent years. But the multiple threats of climate  change, unprecedented biodiversity loss, social inequality  and risks to human rights, to name but a few, demand a  fresh approach. We need our food systems to be a source  of solutions to such challenges, not a cause of them. That is the opportunity and regenerative thinking is the  means to grasp it. “The natural world has an in-built capacity to grow, evolve  and thrive."
Nestle_80,"In nature, there is no such thing as waste;  everything is regenerative. It is time for business to be  inspired by nature – to move from a linear “take-make-use- lose” model that extracts value, to one that is circular, and  operates in the interests of the system as a whole to sustain  and enhance its health. “This should surely be our goal now. Not only is there   a clear and urgent need for us (and the wider industry)   to take these steps, there is also a compelling business  case for Nestlé to show leadership. “Our customers and consumers are increasingly concerned  to know the impact of the products they buy."
Nestle_85,"Our investors  are seeking to understand that our operations deliver  positive outcomes in the widest sense. And our people  want to work for a company that makes a positive impact. “Nestlé’s regenerative journey begins in agriculture. Regenerative agriculture is rooted in practices that help  improve soil health and fertility, store carbon, retain  moisture and protect and restore biodiversity. But  regeneration at its heart is about people – this is why   we are focused on a just transition – one that inspires,  enables and rewards people in their actions and is fair   in meeting their needs."
Nestle_90,"Farmers’ livelihoods and those   of their communities must be protected. “The word ‘journey’ is so well used it is almost a cliché –  but there is a reason for this: it is because regeneration is a  journey and like all journeys it begins with some first steps,  experimentation, and a lot of learning. But the direction is  clear: inspired by nature, Nestlé will strive to help create a  resilient future for our planet, its people and our company. As we look to the next 150 years, nothing less will do. Engaging our people The move towards regenerative  food systems marks such a  profound development in our  thinking that we have conducted  a major internal communication  campaign around the topic –  mobilizing 276  000 people to think  differently."
Nestle_95,"As part of the internal   campaign we:  –Held training sessions  and raised awareness  through different events  around the world  –Conducted (and continue to  conduct in 2022) live internal  interviews with experts  –Used internal platforms   to share videos, imagery,   news and more  –Recruited internal   Ambassadors  –Launched a regeneration  in action playbook“Regenerative food systems  are not aspirational, they are  pragmatic. They benefit the  entire supply chain, the whole  of the company, and all of  global society.” What advancing  regenerative food systems   at scale means to Nestlé We are very clear in our intention,  and each word explains a specific  part of our shift in thinking and the  acceleration of our activities:  –Advance by raising our voice   and using our influence  to drive progress in  collaboration with others   –Regenerative to help  protect, renew and restore  farmland and landscapes  –Food systems encompass  every actor, activity, process  and product in growing,  raising, making, delivering  and consuming food  –At scale because the  planet, communities and  individuals need global,  systems-level changeareas. These soils resist erosion and act as reservoirs in  times of drought and sponges in times of torrential rain,  making crops more resilient to the vagaries of climatic  change. From butterflies to bees, cover crops feed and  nourish pollinators, which are responsible for one-third   of everything we eat. Water coming from regenerative  farms is cleaner, with less pollutants that can damage  rivers, fish, and seas."
Nestle_100,"For the farmer, the cost of inputs  and equipment go down over time – and profits go up. Reducing and eliminating pesticides and herbicides   means better health for the soil and for workers and farm  families. Employing regenerative techniques, the income   for small holder farms increases, income that can be  devoted to children’s education. “The adoption of regenerative agricultural techniques  is a framework that improves every aspect of what  Nestlé produces and every facet of the world it touches,  nourishes and supports. It is a vitally important and crucial  undertaking, the benefits of which will grow and proliferate  now and far into the future."

Nestle_110,"The aim is to provide resilient and fair livelihoods and  dignified work that enable people across the world   to support themselves and their families. The path to regenerative agriculture is a long-term journey  with challenges. This is why we will help farmers by  offering investment, rewarding good practices and offering  technical and scientific guidance. This, together with the  respect and promotion of human rights, will contribute   to a just transition to regenerative food systems. The bigger picture Advancing regenerative food systems is about co-creating  a resilient future for our planet and its people, working   to nurture communities, to improve the livelihoods   of our partners and the well-being of our consumers,   and to revitalize natural ecosystems."
Nestle_115,"This is why the effort requires understanding and support  from all the actors involved, from governments and non- governmental organizations to our peer companies and  competitors, financial institutions and commodity traders. We all have a part to play in helping to make regenerative  food systems a reality.Naturally interconnected Our planet’s water, soil and carbon  storage are intrinsically linked, and  critical for the sustainability of our  food systems. Our approach reflects  this interconnectivity. When we help replenish and restore  the environment, we simultaneously  contribute positively to nature and  biodiversity in our soils, oceans and  forests. We impact the future of  youth, farmers and rural communities,  and we promote respect for human  rights, livelihoods and animal welfare."
Nestle_120,"For Nestlé, interconnected thinking  also means that our research and  development (R&D), sourcing, product  packaging, logistics and consumer  offering become relevant for the  world we live in today: a world that  urgently needs decarbonization  for its survival, as well as social  equity and opportunity through  diversity and inclusion. With the severity of climate change  impossible to ignore, embracing  a whole new way of thinking is  now urgent. Systemic change is  required. For Nestlé, embarking on  a journey toward regenerative food  systems is how we can contribute  to achieving the scale of change  required for society. By considering all these factors we  can all play our role in advancing  regenerative foods systems at scale."

Nestle_165,"This helps us to identify the economic, social  and environmental topics that matter most to our business  and our stakeholders. Conducting a thorough analysis  in this way not only helps identify topics to cover in our  reporting but also supports decisions on where to focus  internal resources. The assessment is undertaken by an independent third  party to ensure complete confidentiality and impartiality. The 2020 assessment results are available on our website. Although these are the material issues facing our business,  they should not be viewed in isolation."
Nestle_170,"They are increasingly  interconnected and can often impact each other. This is  why we are moving more toward an integrated, holistic  approach to managing sustainability and the associated risks   by fully integrating our materiality process with Nestlé’s  Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. This ensures  that sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks   and opportunities being considered across the company. Our next materiality assessment is due in 2022. As a business leader, we are committed to transparency  and action on climate-related risks and opportunities."

Nestle_280,"Many of our affordable nutrition products also  contribute to addressing common deficiencies through  micronutrient fortification.Performance Improving the nutritional  quality of our products We continue to work on sugar  and sodium reductions as part of  our efforts to improve the overall  nutritional profile of our products. Between 2014 and 2020, we reported  the removal of more than 99 000  equivalent tonnes of sugars. However,  last year we reported that we still  fell just short of our commitment  to reduce sugars we add by 5% by  the end of 2020. We are pleased  to report that we did achieve this  reduction in 2021.

Containing soya  protein and omega-3 fatty acids, the product achieves a  Nutri-Score A in Europe. Wunda, a new range of pea-based milk alternatives, is  made with yellow peas that provide high-quality protein  and offer strong nutritional value compared with most other  plant proteins on the market."
Nestle_315,"Yellow peas are high in fiber,  low in sugar and fat, enriched with calcium and a source  of vitamins D, B2 and B12. The original, unsweetened and  chocolate recipes all achieve a Nutri-Score A in Europe. Wunda uses FSC-certified cartons, 100% renewable energy  during manufacturing and is certified carbon neutral. The  chocolate variety uses Rainforest Alliance certified cocoa. Wunda avoids the compromises that other milk alternatives  often face."
Nestle_320,"Many such products have a specific taste, are  low in protein or don’t mix or foam well in hot beverages. Wunda pea-based milk alternatives, which were developed  by our intrapreneurs in only six months in our R+D  Accelerator, are highly versatile and an excellent source of  protein and fiber. Wunda has been available in France, the  Netherlands and Portugal since 2021, with a rollout in other  European markets planned in 2022. In October 2021, we published a paper  that brought  together a roundtable of experts to define what nutrition  criteria would look like for plant-based, dairy-free  alternatives. This topic has not been addressed in detail  before and we are pleased to contribute to its development."
Nestle_325,"GRAINSMART™ Balance is based on a science-based  nutritional concept that was developed and validated by  Nestlé scientists in collaboration with experts from Tufts  University in Boston, U.S., Nutrition Research Australia and  the National University of Singapore. It consists of a defined  ratio between carbohydrates, fiber and sugars of 10:1:2. This means for every 10g of carbohydrate there should  be a minimum of 1g of fiber and no more than 2g of free  sugars. We have used the logo on certain products, such as  Nesvita porridge and Nesquik All Natural Porridge in several  European countries, and will roll out its use in 2022. All cereal products that carry our distinctive Green Banner  provide a minimum of 8g of whole grains per 30g serving."

The  current public health crisis, coupled with the economic  effects of the pandemic, has made this situation harder  for many vulnerable consumers, particularly in emerging  countries, and exacerbated key nutrient deficiencies."
Nestle_360,"With the aim of bringing people more nutritious foods,  Nestlé has developed a nutritious sorghum-based porridge  that upcycles a Milo side stream to fully valorize raw  materials and avoid nutrient loss. The sorghum side stream from the Nestlé factory in  Agbara, Nigeria is highly nutritious but is typically not used  during the production of malt for Milo. Now, the sorghum  is blended with cereals such as wheat and maize to meet  regional needs and tastes, under our Golden Morn brand.

Different  farms will have several pathways to choose from based on  personal preferences. To address this, we have identified  160 farming archetypes arranged into eight categorical  clusters as a basis for localized pathways   for market-led approaches. “It is important for us to illustrate on existing farms what   a transformation may look like in their region."
Nestle_515,"These farms  support the dialogue with our suppliers and help us to  identify what further research, training, support tools  and financing may be required. By doing this, we aim  to remove uncertainties, minimize risk and reduce the  hurdles to uptake. “The most impactful commitment is our  approach to use regenerative agriculture   to progress toward net zero.” “Early results from these reference farms are very  encouraging, opening the possibility for dairy farms to not  only move toward net zero, but to potentially remove more  carbon than they emit. The most impactful commitment is  our approach to use regenerative agriculture to progress  toward net zero. Scaling emissions reductions “We are not only piloting future farm models."
Nestle_520,"In many  cases, we have also accelerated existing programs in dairy to professionalize or support a just transition in our supply  chain that takes into consideration the farms’ profitability. This scaling is about creating greater CO2e reductions. The  practices we look at include enriching animal diets, planting  multi-species pasture, improved production management,  biogas digesters, fertilizers and solar panels. Sequestering carbon “Improving soil health is one of the best things we can do  on farms. Building rich, deep, healthy soils has the potential  to sequester carbon and to enhance water percolation and  retention, which results in better climate resilience."
Nestle_525,"All of  this positively impacts the farms’ biodiversity by creating  natural habitats for plants and animals. Soil health can  be improved by reducing tillage, keeping the soil covered  using cover crops such as oats, mustard, clover, peas,  beans, amaranth or millet. Switching to multi-species  pastures, planting trees and hedgerows, and establishing  riparian buffers or silvopasture productions systems further  improves the carbon footprint and biodiversity of the farms. “Beyond this, when coupled with low-stress milk production  systems managed by skilled people, the practices that  are put in place to improve soil health can also boost milk  production and with that farmers’ livelihoods. Net zero farm pilot, South Africa “After just one year, the results of our pilot studies have  been very positive."
Nestle_530,"Our lead test farm in South Africa  reduced its cow herd by 100 animals, yet increased its total  milk yield by 12% since the start of the trial. It has reduced  emissions from electricity by 24% thanks to energy-saving  measures and seen a 53% increase in active carbon in the  soil, sequestering 4 700 additional tonnes of CO2. Significant  carbon sequestration potential remains. Chemical fertilizer  (mainly nitrogen) usage was lowered by 70%, being replaced  with a balanced introduction of additional organic fertilizers  from chicken manure. Pasture yields remain consistent."
Nestle_535,"“There were admittedly some challenges. Low rainfall meant  that in some fields, pastures needed to be re-established,  exposing the top soil and affecting the potential to improve  its health. There were also some practical problems  associated with the smell of the organic fertilizer and  administrative challenges in selling electricity to the grid. On balance, we are satisfied and the pilot farm interventions  are being replicated by other dairy farmers who have been  frequently visiting the pilot farm themselves. “This is an approach that genuinely has the potential   to contribute to a meaningful impact on climate change,  not just for Nestlé but for the whole industry."
Nestle_540,"NESTLÉ EXPERT Net zero dairy Transforming our   dairy supply chains Robert Erhard, Global Head of  Dairy, Corporate Sustainable  Agriculture Development  Arguably, the most important thing we have been  working on in dairy during 2021 has been the development  of net zero dairy farms. Our dairy supply chain is present  in 27 countries and we also work with our supply chains  through cooperatives around the world. In 2018, most of  our GHG emissions were Scope 3 and came from sourcing  ingredients. Dairy is the single biggest source of these  emissions, so tackling them can have a major impact on  our efforts to reach net zero. “We leverage our R&D expertise that ranges from  agricultural sciences, nutrition, food safety, analytics  through to product development to discover novel solutions  that help us to further reduce carbon emissions in dairy."
Nestle_545,"We are establishing research farms to test new solutions  that will be upscaled across over 30 reference farms around  the globe. On these everyday farms we test climate- friendly and regenerative agriculture farming practices  with academic partners and the farming community in the  respective geographic locations. Our aim is to transparently  transform these farms into net zero farms as a reference   for others to learn from. “Regional adaptation is important. The dairy footprint is  an accumulation of emissions coming from different steps  in the production system, each of which have a variety of  practices."
Nestle_550,"Equally, solutions need to take account of the Product portfolio and packaging  We are investing in science and technology solutions that  help reduce our carbon emissions. We look at different  areas, such as ingredients, production processes,  packaging and others. We assess R&D projects early   in their lifespans for potential impact on climate. Brands such as Garden Gourmet, our plant-based food  range, and the Nestlé Health Science brands Persona and  Garden of Life are leading the way in building agricultural  supply chains based on regenerative practices. Advocacy Throughout 2021, we engaged in climate-related advocacy  to encourage rapid and sustained reductions in GHG  emissions through government policies and private sector  leadership."
Nestle_555,"Examples include:  –Joining global calls to action in partnership with  organizations including the World Economic Forum,   We Mean Business and Glasgow is our Business  –Speaking at multiple events at COP26 to support   global progress on emissions reductions  –Market-level advocacy such as linking our net zero  ambition with Nationally Determined Contributions  in the Philippines and joining calls to action for  specific countries, including Japan, to speed up  emissions reductions  –Advocating for global carbon accounting rules that  incentivize companies in the land-use sector to invest  and collaborate at landscape level, through active  involvement in multi-stakeholder platforms and the  organization of two webinars on the topic 95% of our GHG emissions  come from activities in our  supply chain.We also joined the Taskforce on  Nature-related Financial Disclosures  working group in 2021 to advance  the collective understanding of how  to report on risks and dependencies  related to the natural environment. This complements our membership  of the Corporate Engagement  Program run by the Science Based  Targets Network. Outlook We will continue reducing our  GHG emissions across all scopes.

Here are some of the experiences   of farmers involved with the program: Jon Rebiero, Manager, Trinkler Dairy Farm,  California, United States “Our family has been dairy farming for three generations  and we have been supplying fresh milk to Carnation every  day since 2014 to make their evaporated milk. “Trinkler Dairy Farm is the first partner farm within the   Net Zero Initiative. We are piloting new technologies and  sustainable farming practices to show others that it is really  possible to make dairy farms emissions free. “Today on the farm, we use various sustainable practices:  all of our manure that is produced by the cows is either  used to fertilize crops or it is dried and used for bedding."
Nestle_570,"All the water that our farm produces is either used to  irrigate our crops or recycled back through the water  troughs and soakers. Nothing leaves the farm as waste.” “ All the practices we have introduced are  contributing to soil that is healthy, that is pulling  carbon out of the air and banking it. Not only  that, but the healthier soil then grows healthier  crops, which in turn, bank even more carbon  from the atmosphere.” Austin Allred, Royal Dairy Farmer, Washington, United StatesHelping to protect, renew and restore natural resources | Climate and nature NESTLÉ EXPERT The time is now  Patricia Stroup, Chief Procurement  Officer, Nestlé     I grew up on a dairy farm, and later spent 10 years as a  dairy farmer, co-owner and manager of dairy farms in North  Carolina and Pennsylvania. You could say that is where my  career was born. “My team at Nestlé and I believe that the best procurement  practices let us bring the best products to our consumers."
Nestle_575,"We have a three-pillar strategy: best supply, best value and  best care for the planet. The latter is where net zero farms   are key. “We have already begun informing our suppliers about our  net zero transition. We are encouraging them to embrace  lower-carbon, more sustainable farming practices, or we  will have to consider switching our sourcing to farms that  do. We recognize this transition will be a challenge for  farmers and are offering significant support, including  financial and technical help."
Nestle_580,"We realize each farm is unique. They will move at different speeds and need different  approaches and levels of support. But the direction of  travel is clear. We have seen what is possible – sectors  such as dairy can transform into low-carbon, zero- carbon or perhaps even carbon-negative industries with  higher productivity and multiple additional benefits to  communities and nature. Now that we know this, there   can be no turning back."

They provide nutrition, shelter, energy, medicine and  livelihoods to around 1.6 billion people."
Nestle_590,"But as the global population grows, and demand for  food along with it, forests and other natural ecosystems  are increasingly at risk of being converted into farmland. Only through a broad approach that includes assessing  deforestation risks, forest conservation and restoration,  respecting community and land rights and investing in  sustainable production landscapes can we aim to support   a forest positive future. Approach  Launched in June 2021, our Forest Positive strategy    builds on our decade-long work to end deforestation   in our supply chains. Forest Positive means moving beyond just managing  deforestation risks in our supply chain to targeting a  positive impact on our broader sourcing landscapes. Our strategy aims to help conserve and restore the  world’s forests and natural ecosystems while promoting  sustainable livelihoods and respecting human rights,  including empowering Indigenous Peoples and Local  Communities to be stewards of critical natural ecosystems."

Our Responsible Sourcing  Standard is the tool that we use to  operationalize our commitment. Objectives Our objective is to ensure that  the raw materials that we buy do  not originate from:  –Areas converted from High Carbon  Stock forests and habitat such as  peatland, wetlands and savannas  –Areas converted from  natural ecosystems  –Peatlands of any depth, except where  farming practices protect peat –International Union for  Conservation of Nature-protected  areas categories I-IV  –UNESCO World Heritage Sites   and wetlands on the Ramsar List Cut-off dates  –Meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, sugar:  December 31, 2015  –Soya: Aligned to sectoral cut-off dates  where they exist (e.g. Amazon Soy  Moratorium). When no sectoral cut- off date exists, we apply December 31,  2015 as a cut-off date Our approach  To implement our no-deforestation  commitment, we take a risk-based  approach."
Nestle_620,"We map our supply chains to know where the raw materials that we  buy come from. In at-risk origins, we   take steps to verify that our purchases  are not contributing to deforestation   or conversion of natural habitats.

Nestle_645,"By prioritizing  community rights, companies like Nestlé can advance  their vision of a forest positive future as well as global  conservation and climate goals. “Making up a global population of 2.5 billion, Indigenous  Peoples, local communities and Afro-descendant Peoples  customarily claim almost half of the world’s lands and  forests yet have legal rights to less than 20%. “Customary and formal claims frequently overlap with  companies’ sourcing areas, restricting positive forest and  livelihood outcomes in supply chains. Furthermore, few  countries explicitly recognize communities’ rights to carbon  in customary lands. “While companies struggle to monitor these local and  persistent impacts, emerging legislation in the European  Union and United Kingdom targeting human rights and  deforestation violations will challenge the agricultural sector  to address lands rights issues."
Nestle_650,"“At the same time, recognition of the rights of local peoples  represents a powerful solution to achieving forest positive  strategies. Forests owned or managed by communities  have lower rates of deforestation and higher levels of  biodiversity, yet investment in securing collective land  tenure languishes relative to other priorities. “By leveraging supply chains and influence, as well as  by financially supporting land rights efforts, companies  like Nestlé can make even more progress toward a forest  positive future.

This knowledge will  help bridge the small remaining gap between  97.2% and 100% deforestation-free primary  supply chains for meat, palm oil, pulp and paper,  soya and sugar by 2022, as well as for coffee  and cocoa by 2025."
Nestle_655,"We have committed to carrying out a global  forest footprint for key forest-risk areas in  and around our supply chains by the end of  2023. Learnings from our forest footprints in  Sumatra and North and East Kalimantan in  Indonesia are already informing our Forest  Positive strategy. This will help us identify areas  of future risk and opportunities for forests,  peatlands and customary land rights in and  around our supply chains and take proactive  action. In 2022, we will develop and publish an  action plan on Indigenous Peoples and Local  Communities’ land rights. We are evaluating and validating restoration  opportunities in our sourcing landscapes and  considering other metrics beyond carbon  removal, such as for biodiversity, water quality,  livelihoods and Indigenous Peoples and Local  Communities’ land rights."

Nestle_670,"Global aggregation of data related to regenerative and  organic agriculture (measuring native soil invertebrates  and native insect populations), and conserving natural  landscapes (benefiting people and habitats) will provide a  comprehensive picture of impacts on biodiversity.Approach  Regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming that  aims to improve soil health and soil fertility, as well as  protecting water resources and biodiversity. Restoring soil  health helps draw down and capture increased levels of  carbon in soils and plant biomass. Healthier soils are also  more resilient to the impacts of climate change and can  increase yields, helping improve farmers’ livelihoods. We know that regenerative agriculture plays a critical role in  improving soil health, restoring water cycles and increasing  biodiversity for the long term. These outcomes form the  foundation of sustainable food production and contribute to  achieving our ambitious climate targets."
Nestle_675,"This is why Nestlé  is investing CHF 1.2 billion by 2025 to spark regenerative  agriculture across the company’s supply chain. Our approach will always seek to put farmers at the center  – supporting solutions that are right for their regions and  crops. This is why we have 540 sourcing specialists and  more than 4500 support staff that are assisting with the  transition toward regenerative agriculture. Our strategy begins with pilot studies at farms to validate  new technologies and nature-based solutions. As pilots  prove successful we are expanding into reference farms  of agripreneurs, or entrepreneurial farmers, in different  countries and regions across the world, as soils and climate  requirements will differ."
Nestle_680,"From reference farms we try to  scale the approach to the larger agripreneur community,  helping to further advance and improve their business  models. We plan to roll this out at scale through our Farmer  Connect program, with this transformation benefiting the  larger community. We are also encouraging industry alignment on common  frameworks and metrics for regenerative agriculture. Performance  We are piloting net zero dairy farms to assess the potential  for farms to be managed in a regenerative way that is not  only carbon neutral, but carbon negative. Our efforts to advocate for regenerative agriculture  continued in 2021, including organizing an independent  dialogue on the subject as part of the UN Food Systems  Summit and at the United Nations climate forum COP26  and organizing other policy discussions, such as on  the formation of the European Commission’s Farm  to Fork strategy."

The process for suppliers is not easy. They have to ensure  that their supply chains and farmers are making changes."
Nestle_695,"The first step toward this is fully understanding the changes  that are required. We published a major FAQ document   and held webinars to answer questions, with hundreds   of vendors participating. We also support projects to help suppliers learn more  sustainable practices. For example, the Earthworm  Foundation’s Living Soils Initiative (Projet Sols Vivant) works  with some 30 farmers producing potatoes, sugar beet,  wheat and vegetables in the north of France, providing  technical support and financial tools to help the farmers  improve soil health and, in doing so, hold more carbon in  the soil. Retaining carbon not only prevents carbon dioxide  from being released into the atmosphere, where it can  contribute to climate change, but also enhances water  retention and helps release nutrients for plant growth,  increasing crop yields."
Nestle_700,"In the United States, our Purina PetCare brand started  a project to support environmental stewardship on  50 000 acres of farmland. We work with farmers and  agriculture retailers to help them adopt sustainable  practices. The project measures the outcomes of their  sustainability efforts, quantifying the impact of conservation  practices across areas such as nitrogen efficiency,  erosion, soil quality, greenhouse gas emissions and  carbon sequestration. Overall, we plan to invest CHF 3.2 billion by 2025 to  address climate change, and CHF 1.2 billion of that  is targeted at sparking more regenerative agriculture  practices across our supply chain. With 115 projects co- financed by Nestlé and vendors, we expect that by 2030,  half of our key agricultural raw materials will come from  regenerative sources.“We’ve spent a lot of time  building internal expertise on  climate – training our buyers  and category team members  and creating awareness – so  we can go out and engage with  our vendors on these topics."

It’s all  part of our determination to  get regenerative agriculture  moving in the right direction.”  Arnd Weinlaeder, Purchasing  Group Manager, NestléCASE STUDY Learning from the birds  to restore biodiversity  Birds are a good indicator of healthy coffee farms. If birds  are doing well, the populations of other animals are likely  doing well too, with benefits to water, soil and forests. This  is why Nespresso has been collaborating with the Cornell  Lab of Ornithology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New  York, United States to develop a Biodiversity Progress Index  using avian observation. The first implementation of the Index has been in Costa  Rica and Colombia, where a program called Nuestro Café,  Nuestras Aves (Our Coffee, Our Birds) was rolled out."
Nestle_710,"The program deployed more than 80 sound-recording  units to collect and analyze audio recordings of birdsong,  and engaged with farmers and family members on bird- counting projects and other activities. So far, communities  have found more than 200 species of birds on participating  AAA coffee farms, bringing home the idea that thriving bird  populations go hand in hand with healthy coffee farms. Based on the results of the index, regenerative practices  will be implemented to foster and restore biodiversity in  AAA coffee production landscapes.But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Nespresso has  profoundly embraced the idea of supporting biodiversity  and has recently finished an 18-month long consultation  process with the IUCN. The outcome is a framework   that will help Nespresso monitor biodiversity performance  at a total company level."

Nestle_720,"Background  Water is a finite natural resource. We recognize the  need to play our part in helping to protect, restore and  renew water sources: in Nestlé Waters, our bottled-water  business; throughout our agricultural supply chain and  production operations; and in the communities wherever  Nestlé has an impact. As the climate changes and populations grow, the  availability of clean, safe water is under threat. Water stress,  where demand exceeds the amount of good quality water  available, is a growing problem. By 2050, it is estimated  that more than half the world’s population will be affected  by water stress unless action is taken."
Nestle_725,"Often, it is the most  vulnerable communities – those lacking infrastructure and  most exposed to increasing annual temperatures – that  face the most challenging water-related impacts. Water is a vital resource for farmers – without it they cannot  grow the raw materials we source to produce our foods   and beverages. In fact, agriculture accounts for 70% of all  water withdrawals worldwide and agricultural inputs such  as fertilizers can also affect the quality of water sources. In some regions, increased water consumption to grow and  produce food for an expanding and increasingly urbanized  population is contributing to increased pressure on the  natural water cycle. The water cycle does not operate in isolation."
Nestle_730,"Forests help  regulate precipitation – for example, about half of Europe’s  rainfall comes from forest evapotranspiration. Disruptions  to the water cycle can impact livelihoods, through drought  or flooding. It is estimated that up to one million species  rely on freshwater habitats. Millions more, including  humans, rely on these species as a food source.

Nestle_740,"Our Nestlé Waters business Our bottled-water business, including brands such as  Perrier, S.Pellegrino, Vittel and Buxton, aims to advance   the regeneration of the water cycle to help create a positive  water impact everywhere it operates by 2025. Our plan is to implement more than 100 projects around  our 48 global waters sites, supported by a CHF 120 million  investment. From 2025 onwards, our aim is for these  projects to help nature retain more water than our   bottled- water business uses. All projects are measurable, using the World Resources  Institute’s Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting  methodology. This methodology provides consistency   in analyzing water management activities and helps   focus our activities on addressing current and future   shared water challenges."
Nestle_745,"Using this methodology,   a newly created external panel will review the relevance   and sustainability of the projects and give feedback   on whether they are helping to address local challenges  and opportunities. Nestlé Waters will strive toward  continued reporting of water usage at each of its sites   and on what its projects contribute to the area.

Nestle_750,"Water stewardship across Nestlé We aim to take a holistic approach to water stewardship that considers our operations, our bottled-water business,   our agricultural supply chains and the communities affected throughout.Approach The impacts of water stress are already being felt locally   by communities, including by farmers and consumers. As such, our approach to water stewardship must be local,  or context-based, too. Nestlé uses various sets of publicly available data from   four independent sources to evaluate the water stress   at our factory locations. Each Nestlé site receives a score,  allowing us to identify a list of Where It Matters locations   to prioritize actions. Our context-based approach involves a three-step  roadmap from local to wider catchment level: compliance  as a minimum, then best practice in water resources  management, and collective action."
Nestle_755,"Nestlé performs regular assessments of local water  resources and water use inside and outside its factories,  including possible future risks. We engage with  stakeholders and monitor external research findings. Our approach to water management is overseen by the  Nestlé ESG and Sustainability Council, supported by the  ESG Strategy and Deployment Unit.

This contributes toward conserving and  restoring farmland and the associated ecosystems. Essential to this is optimizing organic fertilization, soil  conservation, structure and organic matter content,   and improving irrigation technology. Building on our extended 2020 commitment, we continue  to engage with suppliers, especially those in agriculture,  on water resource management. We use the Nestlé  Responsible Sourcing Standard to specify to the more than  150 000 direct suppliers and more than 500 000 farmers  we work with what we expect in terms of water use and  water management practices."
Nestle_765,"It sets out basic, mandatory  standards as well as important and urgent sustainability  practices, including water resources management. Traceability is key in identifying areas of water risk in our  supply chains. Using commodity-based assessments and  the Water Footprint Network methodology, we assess  the water footprint of key agricultural commodities and  highlight opportunities for actions aimed at better water  management practices.Water in communities We recognize that access to safe drinking water and  sanitation is a basic human right, and that safe water,  sanitation and hygiene (WASH) contribute to health,  well-being, personal dignity and community resilience. Ensuring access to safe drinking water and sanitation for  Nestlé employees is our priority as a business. Supporting  access to water for the communities surrounding our direct  operations and in our agricultural supply chains helps  strengthen our business and society."
Nestle_770,"Nestlé supports WASH projects in schools and villages near  its operations and in its supply chains around the world. Water partnerships and advocacy Water is a shared resource, so caring for it must be through  collaborative actions. In 2008, a group of business leaders – from the World  Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Water  Security and its International Finance Corporation –  came together to establish the 2030 Water Resources  Group (2030 WRG). Nestlé has been a member of this  consortium from the start and a dedicated supporter  ever since. The 2030 WRG has a simple purpose: to  build strong partnerships in pursuit of more sustainable  water management."
Nestle_775,"Since 2008, we have been part of the CEO Water Mandate,  a UN Global Compact initiative that unites business leaders  on water, sanitation and Sustainable Development Goals. Our involvement in the CEO Water Mandate also includes  membership of the WASH4Work initiative, which asks  businesses to take action to address WASH challenges  in the workplace, in communities where the business  operates and in supply chains. As of 2021, the World  Business Council for Sustainable Development’s WASH  Pledge, of which we are also a signatory, has also become  part of the WASH4work initiative.Performance We continuously strive to improve water savings at Nestlé  factories. In 2021, we delivered absolute savings of 2.3  million m3 of water through more than 150 projects. Total  water withdrawals at Nestlé factories were 98 million m3  (2020: 115 million m3)."
Nestle_780,"This reduction is in part due to the  divesture of a significant part of our bottled-water business  in North America during 2021.

The approach is based on two key areas. The first is to  build on the foundations that have already been put in  place."
Nestle_785,"Our agronomists will continue to train farmers  throughout our supply chains on good water management  practices. Where we have identified watershed preservation  actions that we can take together with farmers and local  stakeholders, these will be actioned. These are largely  targeted at watersheds where our supply chain is exposed  to higher water risks and will include both reducing  farmer dependency on water and ensuring the sustainable  availability of water. The second area is about innovatively regenerating local  water cycles in direct proportion to our local agricultural  water footprint. We will put programs in place to help  ensure that water is not used beyond what is naturally  regenerated, in order to achieve a positive water balance   at the watershed level."
Nestle_790,"We presented our proposed new approach at the  Stockholm World Water Week 2021 Nestlé workshop,  which was attended by leading water experts and  stakeholders. We received positive feedback that the  right approach is to go beyond the farm to address  watershed issues. In the coming years, we will set up action plans and  monitor our progress and engagement with local key  stakeholders where collective action is needed. Our initial  focus will be on our coffee and dairy supply chains. Nestlé Waters will also help support the regeneration of  water cycles and will continue to identify and implement  additional projects to address local shared water challenges."
Nestle_795,"As we move forward, we believe nature-based solutions  will provide volumetric water benefits by maintaining or  improving watershed replenishment. This will be achieved  through reforestation that prevents runoff and through  long-term wetland preservation.In our operations, in 2021, we successfully carried out   five Water Resource Reviews, up from two in 2020. Travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic   again prevented us from meeting our extended 2020  commitment of 40 Water Resource Reviews in total. We spent 2021 developing future plans following the end   of our 2020 commitments and will begin implementing  these new plans in 2022 and beyond. In July 2021, we announced our pledge to help create  a positive water impact everywhere our bottled- water business operates by 2025."

Nestle_820,"It can  also provide important information, such as the origins of  ingredients and nutritional content. Packaging is optimized  to protect food and beverages by using durable materials  such as glass, metals, paper and plastics. Globally, the amount of packaging that is inappropriately  managed at the end of its life is a serious and persistent  environmental problem. Up to 13 million tonnes of plastic   end up in the ocean every year, endangering marine  animals, birds and fish. Inadequate waste management   can also create hazardous conditions for people."
Nestle_825,"The infrastructure to collect, sort, reuse and recycle  packaging varies not only by country, but also by  municipality. While packaging recycling schemes have  helped to start a circular economy for recovered materials,  many regions are not yet able to manage packaging,  food and other end-of-life materials in a circular way. In  less-developed countries, municipal authorities often  do not have the resources to implement suitable waste  management strategies. Reducing waste, increasing recyclability and circularity, and  managing recovered materials effectively are critical for  society, and consumer goods companies play an important  role. We are making the sustainable transformation of our  packaging an urgent priority."
Nestle_830,"At Nestlé, we use many materials for packaging that all  need to meet stringent food safety requirements and have environmental impacts that we need  to consider carefully before making  any change. We are making good  progress in meeting our targets to  have all packaging designed for  recycling by 2025, and we will work  with public authorities and other  players in the development of the  necessary infrastructure that will  allow its effective recycling. Packaging accounts for around 10%  (or 9.5 million tonnes of CO2e) of our  in-scope carbon footprint. Improving  packaging design, production  processes, recycling rates and end- of-life management can therefore  make a notable impact on our efforts  to reach net zero emissions by 2050 .

Our approach to  packaging is overseen by the Nestlé ESG and Sustainability  Council, together with business leadership, with support  from the ESG Strategy and Deployment Unit, the public  affairs and legal departments, and Nestlé’s R&D scientists. In 2019, Nestlé joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s  New Plastics Economy initiative. We pledged to work  across the industry to create a circular economy for plastic,  starting with packaging – eliminating unnecessary plastic   in our packaging and innovating to make the plastic that   we do need recyclable and reusable. *  Our intention is to follow the nine Golden Rules, which are  voluntary, independent and time-bound commitments on  which all members of the Consumer Goods Forum’s Plastic  Waste Coalition for Action are aligned in order to drive  progress in packaging design and development toward  a circular model."
Nestle_840,"The second golden rule is to ‘Remove problematic elements  from packaging’. As such, we have identified several plastic   types, including polystyrene, that are unlikely to be included   in municipal recycling systems around the world. Since 2019,   we have been phasing out materials included in our  Negative List from our packaging.Helping to protect, renew and restore natural resources | Packaging and circularity * As per Ellen MacArthur Foundation definitions.Less packaging Better packaging Better system Reduce Reuse and refill Redesign Recycle Rethink behaviors Reducing our use of plastic packaging  material in general and virgin  plastics in particularScaling reusable and refillable  systems to eliminate the need for  disposable packagingPioneering alternative   packaging materials   to facilitate recyclingSupporting infrastructure   that helps to shape   a waste-free futureRethinking behaviors   of Nestlé, retail   partners and consumers5 4 3 2  1Our five-pillar strategy  Pillar 1: Less packaging - Reduce We are reducing packaging materials by removing  unnecessary plastic lids, accessories, layers and films. For  example, in Egypt, we have eliminated plastic bottle cap  tear-off bands from Nestlé Pure Life water bottles, getting  rid of 240 tonnes of PVC annually. We are also eliminating  close to 2 300 metric tonnes annually by removing Gerber  baby food over-cap lids."
Nestle_845,"Pillar 2: Less packaging - Reuse and refill We are testing and scaling different models of single- use packaging-free delivery and reusable and refillable  solutions. For example, in Canada, we established new  refillable packaging pilots through our partner TerraCycle’s  online Loop platform, which allows people to order refills  for home delivery. Once products are consumed, containers  are collected from homes or at drop-off locations in  store, cleaned and put back into circulation. In France,  we are offering this service in partnership with leading  supermarket chain Carrefour, where Nesquik, Ricoré coffee  and Chocapic Bio (organic) cereals are now available  in reusable Loop containers. Vittel and S.Pellegrino  natural mineral waters in Carrefour stores in Paris can  also be purchased in reusable glass bottles from Loop  with a deposit."
Nestle_850,"Customers get their deposits back, paid  directly into their bank accounts, once they have returned  their used bottles. Similarly, in Canada, Häagan-Dazs can be purchased in  reusable containers, while other refillable pilots are ongoing  with major retailers in the country, as well as in the United  States. for dairy, coffee and waters. Pillar 3: Better packaging - Redesign We are continuously working to develop novel technologies  and innovative packaging solutions. For example, we  are well on our way to eliminating all plastic straws from  our products, using paper as an alternative material."
Nestle_855,"The  innovation required Nestlé to develop an entirely new  supply chain to meet a key technical challenge: bendable  paper straws that are durable enough for consumers, while  meeting rapid dissolvability criteria for paper recycling. To achieve this result, we worked with suppliers and our  R&D packaging experts on new paper technologies and  manufacturing processes, as well as a new scientific  methodology to test the safety and reliability   of our paper straws. Several pilots launched in 2019 and continued through 2021  in key markets to reach an annual quantity of 4.5 billion  paper straws while eliminating 1 632 tonnes of plastic. Paper straws for ready-to-drink products have been rolled  out across various locations, including Pakistan, Malaysia,  Indonesia, Brazil and the Dominican Republic. The paper is  sustainably sourced and certified by the FSC."
Nestle_860,"Worldwide, we transitioned our Smarties range of products  to recyclable paper packaging, a first for any global  confectionery brand. This transition helped eliminate  plastic from approximately 250 million packs sold  globally each year. We have also started to replace the plastic- and aluminum- layered packaging of Nesquik with grease-resistant  coated paper. In 2021, we began changing the wrappers  of organic Maggi bouillon cubes in France, from a multi- layer laminate that included aluminum to recyclable and  sustainably sourced paper.Pillar 4: Better system - Recycle Greater uptake of recycling in our markets requires  improved waste management infrastructure and changes   in behavior – for Nestlé, retail partners and consumers alike. In Indonesia, Nestlé became the first food company to  partner with Project STOP , a collaboration with cities and  governments in Southeast Asia to prevent ocean plastic  leakage."
Nestle_865,"The project is aimed at creating sustainable,  circular and low-cost systems for end-of-life materials  that capture as much value as possible. It supports many  existing local initiatives and waste pickers in coastal areas  and collected around 70 tonnes of waste and nine tonnes   of plastic waste per day in 2021. Nestlé Egypt is committed to recovering and recycling as  much plastic as it sells. In 2021, this amounted to 18 000  tonnes of PET through the Dorna initiative, a collaboration  with the Egyptian Ministry of Environment, together with  partners CID Consulting and PayMob. Dorna aims to boost  waste collectors’ collection capacity with monthly targets  and monetary incentives.Pillar 5: Better system –   Rethink behaviors We are working with consumers,  retailers and communities to  encourage and stimulate responsible  behavior."
Nestle_870,"Through partnerships and  new programs, our goal is to help  make recycling an easy seamless  process.

In coffee and cocoa, the Nespresso AAA Sustainable  QualityTM Program, the Nescafé Plan and Nestlé Cocoa Plan   provide additional requirements specific to these   raw materials. Our key partners and sourcing teams also carry out regular  farm visits and assessments against our Responsible  Sourcing Standard, in addition to third-party audits   and certification where relevant. Finally, while our main consideration is the people within  our direct supply chain and their immediate families,   we also support activities that reach into the wider  community, such as building schools, providing access   to water  and sanitation and running women’s literacy   and numeracy programs."
Nestle_925,"Beyond responsible sourcing Building on years of work with suppliers and farmers to  source key raw materials that are traceable and responsibly  sourced, we are now raising the bar with a more  comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing,  addressing and reporting on social, environmental and  animal welfare risks in our supply chain. Our new approach will help build the foundations to  advance regenerative food systems at scale. Going  forward, we are focusing on the systematic deployment  of our responsible sourcing requirements through our  supply chain to help transform agricultural production  practices in a way that has a positive impact on people,  nature and climate. To measure progress, we have defined a new ‘produced  sustainably’ key performance indicator (KPI) for our 14  priority raw materials that combines multiple requirements  (see adjacent box). This replaces our two previous  commitments and related KPIs that came to a close   in 2020: percentage of volume traceable and percentage   of volume responsibly sourced."

Nestle_950,"We have  committed to achieve deforestation-free cocoa and coffee by  2025. In 2022, we launched an Income Accelerator Program  that aims to improve the livelihoods of cocoa families. See  page 46 for more details. In dairy, we will continue to develop our net zero dairy farm  pilot studies – gradually expanding and implementing the  learnings to other farms around the world. CASE STUDY The Nestlé Cocoa Plan  Supporting bright futures  for cocoa farmers Better cocoa, better farming and better lives are the three  foundational pillars of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan."
Nestle_955,"Our ambition  is to source 100% of the cocoa we use in our products  through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan by 2025. We offer farmers training and resources to help increase  their yields. We have also distributed over 16 million higher- yielding cocoa plants to replace aging, less productive  ones. Additionally, we are helping farmers develop  alternative income sources such as beekeeping and  empowering women to earn their own incomes. At the  same time, we are working to protect the environment."

Nestle_970,"In dairy, we are  helping farmers introduce cover crops  to pastures to reduce feed costs. Providing financial assistance In some rural areas, there is a lack  of financial infrastructure to allow  farmers to save or borrow money. The  Nestlé Cocoa Plan has helped farmers  access basic financial services  through the creation of 270 village  savings and loans associations. Agripreneurship The Nescafé Plan provides training  to many of our farmers in basic  business skills such as bookkeeping. In addition, in Southeast Asia our  operations have introduced the  Farmer Business Schools (FBS)  concept in collaboration with the GIZ  Sustainable Cocoa Business Project."
Nestle_975,"Since its introduction in 2018 over  10 000 farmers have been trained. FBS is a comprehensive learning  approach that targets changing the  mindset of smallholder farmers to  become entrepreneurs, with some  participants more than doubling net  farm income in 12 months. Diversification We encourage farmers to reduce  their exposure to global market  prices for their main crop (and boost  biodiversity) through ‘intercropping’ –  planting other crops in their fields. We  also encourage income diversification  through activities such as beekeeping  and biogas and renewable  energy generation. Women’s empowerment Data from the Nestlé Cocoa Plan  clearly demonstrates a link between  higher levels of women’s education  and reduced risks of child labor."
Nestle_980,"Activities such as founding women’s  groups, developing income-generating  activities and providing literacy and  numeracy courses are all part of  our efforts to support women, their  families and wider communities. Premiums In Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, Nestlé  was one of the first companies to  purchase 2020/2021 cocoa with the  governments’ joint Living Income  Differential premium. We believe it  can be a useful tool to complement  our efforts to improve the lives of  farmers and their communities  through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan. Our evolving regenerative agriculture  approach also envisions the use  of cash incentives for vulnerable  smallholders supplying ingredients  grown using regenerative methods. Direct investments will also help  support farmers during this time."

These were mainly low-risk countries with a substantial  number of factory workers with no computer access and  where in-person training was made difficult because of  COVID-19 restrictions."
Nestle_1040,"By the end of 2021, we closed  this gap in most countries. In addition, it is part of the  mandatory training for all new employees, which will  ensure that all future employees are trained. In 2021, we improved our grievance mechanism   by integrating our former Integrity Reporting System  (for employees) and our external platform (for all other  stakeholders) into an independently operated system  called ‘Speak Up ’. In June 2021, our UK and Australian markets worked  together to produce their first joint Modern Slavery and  Human Trafficking report to address the requirements   of their countries’ modern slavery acts. This demonstrates  the collaboration and consistency of our coordinated  global approach."
Nestle_1045,"57 892 Employees trained   on human rights in 2021 Promoting human rights in agricultural supply chains Our efforts to source sustainably  have enabled us   to make important progress in promoting human rights   in agricultural supply chains. In 2021, we launched a detailed labor rights action plan for  palm oil. We are working toward a palm oil supply chain  where all workers, at all tiers of production, work and live  in safe and healthy conditions, are provided contracts  detailing their working conditions, are paid fairly, have the  right to associate freely and collectively bargain and have  access to grievance mechanisms. Our long-term Forest Positive strategy, announced in  2021, is helping us to find ways to integrate further  protection for tenure-based rights for Indigenous People  and Local Communities into our approach, while at  the same time helping smallholder farmers to develop  sustainable livelihoods. Child labor risks and access to education  We were the first company in the cocoa sector to introduce  a Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System  (CLMRS), and many companies have now adopted it as a  leading tool that helps tackle child labor risks by working  directly with communities on the ground."
Nestle_1050,"Our CLMRS  prioritizes access to education, including building and  renovating schools and securing birth certificates for  registration, and tackling rural poverty through income  diversification programs and support. The CLMRS is a six-step process that starts with raising  awareness. Community Liaison People visit farmers and  cooperatives, and based on visits and surveys, identify  children at risk. Families of children identified receive  further visits where they are advised and supported by the  Community Liason People. Regular follow-up visits allow us  to measure how many children have been prevented from  entering child labor or have stopped doing hazardous work."
Nestle_1055,"Each year, we identify some children in our supply chain  who are at risk of engaging in child labor. We carry out  follow-up visits with each of these children and record the  number who report that they are no longer at risk during  two consecutive visits. In 2021, the number of children who  reported no longer being at risk at the two most recent  visits was 6 307 in Côte d’Ivoire and 738 in Ghana. Collaborating to reimagine fairer food systems In 2021, Nestlé partnered with Tufts University to convene   a UN Food Systems Summit dialogue with stakeholders   to discuss the nexus between regenerative food systems  and the right to food. In total, 57 participants from academia, non-governmental  organizations, the private sector and UN organizations  discussed the major barriers and corresponding levers   to making healthy diets affordable, accessible and  adequate for everyone, including the responsibilities   of different stakeholders in ensuring access to safe   and nutritious food for all, collectively moving toward   the 2030 SDGs."

In January 2022, to expand our work to tackle poverty  as a root cause of child labor risks, we launched a novel  approach that aims to support farmers and their families  in the transition to more sustainable cocoa farming. The  Income Accelerator Program will pay cash incentives  directly to farming families for activities such as school  enrollment, sustainable agricultural practicexs, agroforestry  and income diversification. The incentives will encourage  behaviors and agricultural practices that are designed to  steadily build social and economic resilience over time. These incentives are paid on top of the premium introduced  by the governments of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana that Nestlé  pays and the premiums Nestlé offers for Rainforest Alliance  certified cocoa."
Nestle_1065,"The payments are not linked to production  volumes and reward cocoa-farming families for the benefits  they provide to the environment and local communities. By incentivizing practices such as generating diversified  incomes, for example through growing other crops, raising  livestock such as chickens, beekeeping or processing other  products like cassava, we are also building on our previous  commitment to improve food availability and dietary  diversity among the farmers who supply us. 85 Company and supplier  representatives in Turkey’s  hazelnut supply chain  received training in labor  rights issues in 2021CASE STUDY Harvesting the future  Nestlé began working with the Fair Labor Association (FLA)  in Turkey in 2012 to help seasonal workers in our hazelnut  supply chain address challenges relating to labor conditions  and child labor risks. To help improve recruitment and employment practices   for seasonal migrant workers, we needed to address   the root causes across all the seasonal jobs that workers   move between in Turkey’s agriculture sector. As a result, in 2019, we joined Harvesting the Future, a multi- sectoral, multi-geography and multi-stakeholder project led  by the FLA to help supply chain partners address working  conditions for their shared seasonal workforce."
Nestle_1070,"The program in 2021 focused on child protection and child  labor risk emediation, elimination of hazardous work for  workers under the age of 18, improved access to basic  services and greater adherence to responsible recruitment  practices, grievance mechanisms and living wages. So far, 85 company and supplier representatives have  received training in these areas. A total of 12 suppliers  have launched child labor risk monitoring and remediation  programs, and we increased awareness and registration   of labor intermediaries. Read more hereThe palm oil supply chain is far  reaching and complex. Millions of  workers, from plantations to mills  and refineries, are part of our palm  oil sourcing journey."
Nestle_1075,"We want to help  our suppliers build a palm oil supply  chain free from human rights issues  such as forced labor, discrimination  and health and safety hazards. Our approach between 2010 and  2017 was based on conducting  site assessments against our  Responsible Sourcing Standard. We worked with our suppliers and  partners to develop time-bound  action plans to address the gaps  found and supported suppliers,  mills, plantations and smallholders  in our supply chain to address  specific labor rights risks such as  forced labor and child labor, through  targeted interventions. After conducting a labor rights  assessment of Nestlé’s Indonesian  palm oil supply chains, we  developed our first dedicated  Action Plan on Labor Rights in  Palm Oil Supply Chains in 2018 with the collaboration of the Danish  Institute for Human Rights and  Earthworm Foundation. With our partner Verité, we then  conducted a Management Systems  Assessment of how we manage  labor rights risks in our palm oil  supply chain globally."
Nestle_1080,"In 2019,  Verité deepened this assessment  by conducting in-depth reviews  of two of our suppliers in order  to understand how the Nestlé  Responsible Sourcing Standard  translates into practices throughout  the supply chain. Verité conducted comprehensive  labor and occupational health and  safety assessments of seven mills  and 11 estates across Malaysia and  Indonesia that collectively employ  over 4 000 workers, including  interviews with over 200 workers. The results and recommendations  made in this assessment, together  with our previous experience and  learnings, led to the revision of our  labor rights approach in palm oil.Working with Verité, we developed,  and are now implementing, a  Program Assurance Framework  which focuses on strengthening  management systems for assessing,  addressing and remediating labor  rights issues. We are also continuing  to train palm oil suppliers and  producers on the guidelines and  tools that we have helped to develop  over the years, that explain specific  labor-related issues and how they  can be addressed. To address labor rights issues  we have learnt that it is critical to  incorporate changes into broad  landscape initiatives where we  determine priority issues and deploy  solutions to improve conditions  for workers."
Nestle_1085,"This is why we are  supporting several landscape  approaches that address labor rights  within their scope. We are collaborating with partners  and suppliers to systematically  deploy more comprehensive labor  rights requirements through our  supply chains. Together with workers, governments, multilateral and non-  governmental organizations, peer  companies, certification bodies,  individual experts and our partners,  as well as with various industry  associations and multi-stakeholder  platforms, we are working to better  understand and help tackle the root  causes of crucial labor rights issues. Leveraging participation in multi- stakeholder platforms, particularly  in the Consumer Goods Forum  Forest Positive Coalition, we are also  advocating for the development of  regulations, policies, programs and  incentives to create a conducive  environment for labor rights. Our vision is one of a sustainable palm  oil sector, where nature is protected  and restored, where human rights,  including labor rights, are respected,  and where workers and smallholder  farmers are offered decent work and  livelihoods."
Nestle_1090,"As we implement our  Palm Oil Labor Rights Action Plan,   we will continue to test new tools   and approaches to ensure a strong  and relevant approach for the future. Strengthening communities | Human rights Our Human Rights Framework and Roadmap  guides our approach to protecting people in   our supply chains. “Nestlé and Verité developed  the Program Assurance  Framework to take into  account macro, labor and  operational risks in the supply  chain. The framework is  based on key labor data from  refineries and their direct   and indirect supply bases. It looks at suppliers’ systems  and whether they are set up  to address endemic and long- standing labor issues.” Melizel Asuncion, Senior Director for  Operations, Verité Southeast AsiaContinuing to strengthen   our approachPalm oil and labor rightsCASE STUDY       ADVANCING REGENERATIVE FOOD SYSTEMS AT SCALE            CONTRIBUTING TO NUTRITIOUS AND SUSTAINABLE DIETS            HELPING TO PROTECT, RENEW AND RESTORE NATURAL RESOURCES            STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES           OPERATING RESPONSIBLY            Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2021 4611 598  Apprenticeship and  traineeship opportunities 7 422  Young farmers trained  through the Nestlé  Agripreneurship Program 23 899  Job opportunities  for people under 30 1 291 306  Young people impacted  through digital events (e.g."
Nestle_1095,"career fairs, educational  webinars, e-learning  programs) that focus on  upskilling young people and  make them more employable  (819 678 in 2020) * Delivered specifically through Nestlé  needs YOUth initiativeAs the global economy has slowed during the COVID-19  pandemic, it was young people who were the most  impacted, with a disproportionate number losing their jobs. As economic recovery continues, young people must not be  left behind. By creating the jobs young people need, we can  benefit from their skills, perspectives and abilities. Outside our own operations, it is important for Nestlé to  inspire the next generation of farmers. This is particularly  true as urbanization draws more and more young people   to cities, causing the average age of farmers in many parts   of the world to rise well into the 50s."
Nestle_1100,"Encouraging and supporting young people to develop  livelihoods in farming also creates an opportunity to train  them in regenerative agriculture methods from the start   of their working life. Upskilling young people internally, in our supply chains and  in society in general, is good for us, for individuals and for  communities. As a major employer, we can make a positive  difference, providing employment as well as digital and  physical training and skills development opportunities to  young people. We can also use our position as a global  company to inspire other multinational businesses, driving  collective action to create more training and employment  opportunities than we could achieve alone. This is why the  Nestlé needs YOUth initiative exists and why we founded  the Global Alliance for YOUth, together with 24 other  international private sector companies."
Nestle_1105,"Bringing young people into Nestlé keeps  us in touch with an ever-changing  world. Meanwhile, around the world we  face an ageing farmer population. This  is why inspiring young agripreneurs  and entrepreneurs and investing in  youth employability is at the heart  of regeneration. Background Young people bring fresh ideas and energy to the workplace. They are a crucial part of any company’s long-term talent  pipeline."
Nestle_1110,"Providing opportunities for young people helps  bring more diverse perspectives into our workplace  and strengthens relations with local communities that  benefit from increased employment.

Under each of the three pillars we create broad and diverse  opportunities for youth, with varied levels of engagement  and potential impact on the future of the individuals  involved."
Nestle_1115,"For example, we provide online training and  content and make it widely available to increase their level  of employability. This also helps raise awareness among  young people about the challenges of today’s world of  work and how to overcome them. We also provide on-the- job training opportunities for young individuals through  programs such as Nesternship and our R+D Accelerators. All the opportunities we create contribute to internally  reported metrics in support of our three pillars and our  2030 commitment.Performance  We continued working toward our 2030 commitment   to help 10 million young people around the world have  access to economic opportunities. In 2021, we succeeded  in creating 1.44 million opportunities through the Nestlé  needs YOUth initiative, bringing the cumulative total since  we announced our commitment in 2017 to 3.89 million."
Nestle_1120,"The roll-out of Nestlé needs YOUth across our operations   is part of our work toward our 2030 ambition. Agripreneurship  In September 2021, when we announced our plan to  advance regenerative food systems at scale, we engaged  with key opinion leaders around critical related issues. One of these discussions focused on ‘empowering young  agripreneurs’ and how we can work together with our  stakeholders to make agriculture more attractive to young  people. The discussions provided valuable insights that we  can use for programs, communications and education tools. In 2021, we continued our longstanding Agripreneurship  Program, with a focus on Farmer Business Schools."
Nestle_1125,"These  help to teach farmers relevant business skills with the aim  of making their farms more financially robust. Through this  program, we identified around 15 447 agripreneurs in 2021  who we are training to become future-fit farmers. Those  that are under 30 contributed to our overall total of 7 422 of  young farmers trained through the Nestlé Agripreneurship  Program in 2021. Entrepreneurship  In August we announced the inauguration of our largest  R+D Accelerator  to date, in our fundamental research  center in Lausanne, Switzerland. The R+D Accelerator  concept was launched in 2019 and provides a unique  opportunity for youth start-ups, students and entrepreneurs  to bring their innovations to market quickly."
Nestle_1130,"The internal and external teams have full access to Nestlé’s  infrastructure and R&D experts from around the world. Since 2019, over 257 participants have benefitted from the  R+D Accelerator program and more than 90 products have  been tested in 19 countries. During 2021, Nestlé Middle East and North Africa has been  supporting the Swiss-Middle East Circular Economy for  Youth Initiative. Starting in March, student innovator teams  from the region were identified and given mentorship by  Swiss universities and companies, including Nestlé. Six  teams were selected as finalists and pitched their projects  to a jury at the Swiss Pavillion at Expo 2020 in Dubai,  delayed a year due to COVID-19, but finally held in October  2021."
Nestle_1135,"Plasticycle was the winning team, and in 2022 it  will be receiving training and a special on-site bootcamp  provided by Nestlé in Switzerland. Employability  On October 7 and 8, 2021, Nestlé Colombia hosted the  VI Pacific Alliance Youth Summit, with the live virtual  participation of more than 35 000 young people from Chile,  Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Various high-level government  representatives from the four countries also participated,  including the President of Colombia, Iván Duque. The summit focused on providing awareness, inspiration   and educational content for young people in these countries. In addition, our online internship program, Nesternship,  was further expanded in 2021, helping young people  around the world gain valuable professional experience."
Nestle_1140,"Geographical Zones that ran the program in 2020 also  improved the package for 2021. For example, Zone AOA  (Asia, Oceania, and Africa) added an e-Learning module  on interview skills as part of the assessment process,  together with a completion certificate for the module and  advice on strengths and improvement opportunities. See  the Nesternship case study to find out more about the  program in 2021. Driven by the importance of coffee to Nestlé, in collaboration  with Federación Nacional de Cafeteros in Colombia, we also   launched a pilot training program called Nestlé Young Baristas.

Over the next 12 months we will begin exploring ways  to develop an entrepreneurship platform to help people  with ideas to connect more easily to the R+D Accelerator . We will also add more technical training in regenerative  agriculture to our Agripreneurship Academy. In 2022, we will launch a new Agripreneurship Academy –  online video-based training designed to attract and train  the next generation of farmers to work in a regenerative  way. The academy will address topics ranging from climate  change, agroforestry and soil health to animal welfare."
Nestle_1165,"The  videos will be available on YouTube, accessible anywhere  on any device, and often available in multiple languages. The initial effort will focus on raising awareness of  regenerative farming. Following this we intend to introduce  more technical training to support regenerative agriculture. In the coming year, we will be expanding our Nesternship  program into additional markets across Asia, Oceania  and sub-Saharan Africa. We will also continue to improve  the application portal for potential interns by adding  a new e-learning module."
Nestle_1170,"Similarly, the Nesternship  app will be enhanced with a chat feature and more  educational content. Through the Global Alliance for YOUth, we will continue  to drive and promote positive impacts for young people  among our private sector partners and focus on key themes  such as resilience and agility, as well as to investigate the  important role of digital inclusion in youth opportunities. The global pandemic presented many unprecedented  challenges for business. While many organizations and  individuals have adapted to a new reality, in which much  of our communication is digitalized and handshakes are a  thing of the past, the ripple effects of this are still being felt. As we have seen, one major trend since the start of  2020 has been the negative effect on young people and  employment."
Nestle_1175,"Nestlé’s focus on youth has meant this  cannot be overlooked: we wanted to find a way to provide  young people with training and employment opportunities  during these difficult times. This is why we launched our Nesternship program in Zone   Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. It was  our first Nestlé Virtual Internship Program offering an  experiential online learning opportunity for young people. Not only does it provide an experience tailored to interns’  preferences (for example, working remotely with countries  around the world), from the recruitment process to  the hands-on experience, it also gives them the opportunity  for self-paced learning, to find out more about our values,  and facilitates international peer-to-peer interaction. To help facilitate stronger engagement and connection,  in 2021 we also created a new tool for our ‘Nesterns’ to  access digital learning content at their fingertips."
Nestle_1180,"We  also launched the Nesternship smartphone app. It offers  learning resources on various topics, a chat feature to  interact with fellow Nesterns across Zone Asia, Oceania  and sub-Saharan Africa, notifications on upcoming events  and direct links to apply for job opportunities. The Nesternship program and others like it help us to create  champions of regenerative agriculture and nurture a pipeline  of talent for the next generation of Nestlé leaders who share  our purpose and values.

Nestle_1200,"Healthier employees  tend to be happier, more engaged, higher performing and  more productive. As stated by the International Labour Organization,  as much as being a public health crisis the COVID-19  pandemic has been an employment and social crisis. It has had unequal effects on different groups of people. For example, gender equality has lapsed as women took   on additional childcare and housework responsibilities. Young people’s education has been disrupted and it has  become much harder to find a first job."
Nestle_1205,"COVID-19 also accelerated a shift to more technology- driven flexible work arrangements. E-commerce and tele- services have boomed, artificial intelligence and automation  have driven efficiencies and businesses and employees  have had to change rapidly to keep pace. In 2021, it   became clear that continually adapting how employees  work – physical versus remote working or other methods   of physical distancing – has become an everyday reality. At Nestlé, we responded to this shift.

Nestlé as a ‘force  for good’ is now the bedrock of all our recruitment  communications in all channels and parts of the world. In 2021, we also became more targeted in our recruitment  drives, by headhunting in-demand skills groups using more  specialist channels to reach potential candidates. We also  moved to a proactive recruitment strategy: rather than simply  recruiting for open positions, we now target skills and roles  we regularly recruit for on an ongoing basis."
Nestle_1260,"We measure our success based on our ability to attract  high-caliber candidates who are seeking an employer with  purpose. We monitor engagement with our recruitment  communications and the traffic we drive to our careers site. We are evaluating the skills we will need such as greater  digital and AI capabilities.

The emergence and circulation of  more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 is a significant  concern, highlighting the need for fast vaccination of  employees and for maintaining a comprehensive approach  to protection measures. To avoid the double burden  of COVID-19 and seasonal flu, we also reinforced the  importance of the flu vaccination for markets. To facilitate direct access to health services and to holistic  well-being support, we finalized two global bidding projects  to validate reliable and good quality global providers  for our market Employee Assistance Programs and  Telemedicine support. The Nestlé Know Your Numbers Program (KYNP) enables  us to measure the overall health risks of our employee  population, helping us to better understand health profiles,  the impact of health on productivity and to build strategic,  targeted and evidence-based interventions."
Nestle_1310,"KYNP was  made available to 227 640 employees by the end of  December 2021 and based on the cumulative data, 49 687  Nestlé employees so far have participated in the global  version of the program. The most prominent health risks  continue to be related to stress, unhealthy eating, lack of  physical activity, weight and sleep. Awareness building in the form of educational programs,  such as #HealthyLives training, continues to play a key  role in building the foundations for informed decisions on  healthier lifestyle choices. #HealthyLives, our global training program, includes  guidance and interactive exercises across four dimensions:  physical activity, sleep, nutrition and mental health, and  is available in 16 languages. In 2021, it had a good uptake  and was the non-mandatory training with the highest  completion rate at Nestlé, with 445 776 videos completed  by 31 636 employees."
Nestle_1315,"To support employees implementing  what they have learned, 94.4% of our canteens now offer   a healthy meal and 53.0% of our sites provide a nap room  or equivalent space for resting.

Nestle_1320,"“But it is our global reach that makes diverse teams so  crucial to our success. Without the inclusion of different  and varied voices, knowledge, experiences and abilities,  we would not be able to create value for our customers  and society beyond.

We  see everyone as equal, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender,  national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation,  age and different abilities, leaving no one behind.“This year, we have continued to work toward our  commitments: to empower women as agents of change for  a just transition to regenerative agriculture practices across  our entire value chain; and to increase the proportion of  women in our top 200+ senior executive positions to 30% by  2022."
Nestle_1325,"Although we are proud of the progress we have made  there will always be room for improvement.

Holding up a mirror to  ourselves by joining forces and opening up to transparency  and accountability is key. “But our corporate initiatives come back to our people."
Nestle_1330,"It’s easy to get lost in targets and numbers, regulations,  frameworks and policies – what matters is that every  employee feels safe and happy to be who they are   at their place of work. That they feel supported, valued,   and respected – every day and at every stage of their life. “Success relies on each of us and every individual has their  role to play.

One fatal accident was a road traffic accident,  one occurred on a construction site and one occurred  during production operations. All fatal accidents are investigated by an independent  investigation team to ensure we understand the root  causes. We take action to prevent recurrence and to share  the lessons learned across the company."

Nestle_1380,"Monitoring and reporting Our global CARE Audit program is an internal social  audit verification that aims to ensure that all our  employees and sites operated by Nestlé comply   with local legislation, our Corporate Business   Principles and our Code of Business Conduct. External auditors assess compliance with our Corporate  Business Principles against seven pillars: conditions   of work and employment, business integrity, safety   and health, environmental sustainability, security,   local communities, and labor accommodation. In addition, we have recently issued our evolved  Human Rights Framework and Roadmap that provides  a comprehensive framework to continue developing  our preventive measures to protect human rights   in our business relations with third parties. 2. Communication and  training: dissemination of  processes and tools We run an annual communication campaign in order  to achieve the proper dissemination of ethics and  compliance guidance, as well as information on the  ongoing evolution of our compliance culture, principles  and values."
Nestle_1385,"Training materials and tools are continually  developed and implemented to support and monitor  this dissemination process.4.

Speak Up replaced our internal reporting system and  external Tell Us system and is independently operated by a  third party to ensure anonymity when requested. Speak Up  provides Nestlé employees and all other stakeholders with  a dedicated communication channel for reporting non- compliance concerns."
Nestle_1390,"This new system provides us with  more transparency and better data. We completed   the launch and implementation of Speak Up in all markets  in 2021, with the exception of two that are being migrated  to the new system in 2022. Every allegation is professionally and confidentially  handled. As a consequence of substantiated cases,   133 employees had to leave the company and six service  providers’ contracts were terminated. With the launch of Speak Up, we have also introduced  a new Case Management System."
Nestle_1395,"This is an add-on  feature whereby all the cases reported on Speak Up are  recorded and managed by markets, enabling the anaylsis  of relevant anonymized KPIs and statistics on an ongoing  basis. With the Case Management System, we will have  more complete and accurate information and improved  capabilities to analyze data trends. This will provide us with  more meaningful information and support the development  of improvement plans. To support the launch, we rolled out a comprehensive  communication campaign aimed at reinforcing our culture  of compliance and business ethics, and empowering  employees to use the new system to Speak Up.

Nestle_1400,"Much of the training is related to Nestlé’s Corporate  Business Principles. Employees are required to take  a certain number of compliance training sessions per  year, completing a set of 10 mandatory training sessions  approximately every three years. Several markets run  annual anti-corruption day campaigns. Corruption is also  covered in the Code of Business Conduct, supported   by global training in several languages. CARE audits in 2021  The number of CARE audits increased in 2021 (247)  compared to 2020 (150)."
Nestle_1405,"Our CARE reviews expanded   to include topics related to safety and health and conditions  of work and employment, such as labor accommodation   for on-site workers.Monitoring and reporting We added topics on our compliance reporting in 2021,  including results for our compliance self-assessment   tool, the number of completed mandatory trainings   and conflicts of interest. We also refined the data   collected and how it was shown, creating more  transparency for our geographical zones and markets. Data ethics  We measure our performance on privacy and data ethics  against many internal metrics and comply with legal  requirements in each country where we operate. In 2021, we continued to train employees on data ethics  and how to manage data legally and responsibly through  an iLearn module titled ‘Data Ethics at Nestlé’, as well as  through our Corporate Business Principles e-learning. Through our advocacy program, we aim to be part of the  international conversation on the evolution of data privacy  and use our voice to promote best practice when possible."
Nestle_1410,"Technology-driven transparency Our work with partners to test and deploy technology in our  upstream supply chains continued in 2021. Technology can  support transparency by facilitating end-to-end traceability  and substantiating sustainability claims. With our partner OpenSC, alongside farmers and suppliers  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we designed  a technology blueprint for end-to-end coffee traceability  using smart devices and QR codes. We also tested  methods to monitor and verify certain sustainability  aspects of our supply chains, such as farmer income,  through mobile money. *Data for 2020 has been restated as some audit results were received after the 2020  CSV and Sustainability Report was published.Outlook In the next year, based on our evolved Human Rights  Framework and Roadmap, we will strengthen due diligence  and risk assessment of third parties."
Nestle_1415,"Our mandatory  compliance training and ongoing communication will  continue to help strengthen our ethical business culture. Speak Up and the case management system will be rolled  out to the two final markets, Nestlé USA and Germany. One of the most important areas for Nestlé to anticipate is  the impact of data and digitalization on human rights, and  the implications for individuals creating digital profiles and  sharing personal data. How Nestlé collects and uses data  must be closely regulated internally as well as being at all  times in compliance with local and international standards. There is a clear trend for established data protection and  privacy laws to be strengthened and for countries without  regulations to create new laws."

Tupperware_15,"We welcome your queries and views on this report and your suggestions for improvement. Please contact: sustainability@tupperware.com    About This Report Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - About this report 2In today’s world, with so much information and constant  change, people seek a sense of purpose in their lives. They  seek something they can truly care about to help them stay  motivated, productive and connected to those around them. That longing for purpose starts early. I see this with my two  teenage children – they want to know what sort of work I am  doing and how I am helping to create a better world for them and  future generations."
Tupperware_20,"When I joined as CEO of Tupperware Brands  last year, it really hit me – this is what it is about. Working for a  company and leading teams that have a higher purpose to make  a real impact. This company has a unique and storied history –  and a rightful place in making the world better. When we embarked on our three-year turnaround in 2020,  we started with redefining our purpose. At Tupperware, we all  want to do work we can be proud of and make a difference  for people and for the planet."
Tupperware_25,"We took a refreshed look at why  we do what we do, how we do what we do, and what we do to  make it happen – and defined our new purpose: Every day, we  nurture a better future. This simple phrase connects us all to  the real reason we come to work every day. It connects us to  the opportunities we have to make a difference, individually  and collectively as both Associates within the business and as  partners through our independent Sales Force, suppliers and  others with whom we engage. The Tupperware brand has a  chance to make a difference. In 2021, we committed to a new set of material topics and  developed new incremental goals on top of our already  established ones based on engagement from internal and  external stakeholders."
Tupperware_30,"We were able to gain valuable inputs to help us determine where we should focus our efforts going  forward. We identified what’s important in the eyes of our  stakeholders, including our targets and roadmap, and have  gotten to work on these priorities. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and an  ambitious Turnaround Plan to deliver long-term profitable  growth, I am incredibly inspired and energized by the clarity  and motivation that this process has brought to our company. Our new purpose gives us the freedom to think about different  paths to the Tupperware of the future, modifying our business  model by embracing and optimizing digital platforms, new sales  channels and new product ranges, all the while remaining true to  our core as a company built on relationships that we will forever  cherish. We have had to make some tough decisions as we  restructured the company, and this has not been easy."
Tupperware_35,"However,  in aligning to our new purpose, I feel there has never been a more  exciting time in Tupperware’s history. We have made great strides in improving the sustainability  profile of our ECO+ product lines, using recycled raw materials,  and reducing our environmental impact across several metrics. We have delivered innovations that will make lives easier around  the world while reducing food waste and eliminating single-use  products. I am grateful to all those involved in helping us create a stronger  Tupperware – a brand that is committed to a better future. Thank  you for your interest in our company and in this report."

Companies want to do business  with responsible companies. Investors are seeking sustainable  performance from public  companies such as Tupperware. Sustainability is an integral part  of our Turnaround Plan, and it is  reflected in our new How, Why and  What, supported by our Values.

Tupperware_65,"The environmental  aspects of our products have  not been a main selling point to  date. But I think that is changing. People today are more aware  of the problems of single-use  plastics and of climate change.

Tupperware_80,"In fact, the brand was built on the principles of  sustainability well before the use of the term sustainability gained popularity, by helping households save  time, money and food. To support our Turnaround Plan and to address the many changes in the world due to  the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was the right time to reassess the topics that matter for Tupperware and for our  stakeholders. Working with a leading global expert advisory firm, we embarked upon a process to understand the new Environmental, Social and  Governance (ESG) landscape and the concerns and expectations of our stakeholders, as a basis for decision-making on ways to move  forward. Our process, which was supported by our Board of Directors and involved our entire leadership team, followed a set of distinct  phases, leading up to the definition of our priority sustainability topics and a revised sustainability strategy and associated targets.First,  we engaged our stakeholders We define stakeholders, using the definition of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, as  entities or individuals that can reasonably be expected to be significantly affected by an organization’s  activities, products and services, or whose actions can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of the  organization to successfully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives. Using this definition, we  identified 10 internal and external stakeholder groups."
Tupperware_85,"Internal stakeholders also include our Board of  Directors, executive leadership and other internal leaders. We engaged with these stakeholder groups through targeted surveys, focus groups, interviews and  independent research, including:    • 20 executive and Board interviews  • 2 internal focus groups and survey of 120 functional and market leaders across Tupperware • 10 supplier and NGO surveys  • Interviews with top Sales Force leaders in two major markets • Social media analysis and external stakeholder research Inputs and insights from all stakeholders were analyzed to create the top ranked ESG topics for Tupperware  by group. For each identified topic, stakeholder scores were aggregated to form a shortlist of highest rated  topics by stakeholder group. The topics that were most highly ranked by several stakeholder groups include: • Circular and sustainable business models • Community engagement • Operational and packaging waste • Product innovation • Product safety and quality • Ethics, integrity, and compliance • Culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion For an overview of stakeholder engagement by topic, see GRI 102-44 in the GRI Content Index.Associates Suppliers Investors Regulators Communities Non-Governmental  Organization (NGOs)Sales Force Consumers Retail Customers and  PartnersIndustry AssociationInternal and External Stakeholder Groups Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Our Approach to ESG 8Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Our Approach to ESG 9Operational and packaging  waste Community engagement Culture, diversity, equity,  and inclusion Product innovation Ethics, integrity   and complianceGreenhouse gas emissions  and climate strategy Safe working practices Circular and sustainable  business modelTalent attraction,  development and retention Product safety and qualityEnvironmental Social Human Capital Product Oversight &  GovernanceNext,  we assessed and defined what’s material to Tupperware To create a list of the highest priority ESG topics for Tupperware, we used two main input sources: • Priority ESG topics defined by stakeholder group as noted above •  An assessment of the significance of social and environmental impacts to Tupperware’s business, created  from input provided by Tupperware’s Board of Directors, executive management and functional and market  leads In 2021 and continuing into 2022, we are building on this work by embarking on a maturity model assessment  to fully integrate ESG into the business and prepare the highest quality ESG disclosures.

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  report and major reviews of the science of climate change  published in August 2021 confirms that global temperatures will  continue to rise above 1.5°C during this century, with catastrophic  results for the planet and our ability to thrive on Earth, unless  decisive and drastic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions in the coming years. Our targets toward resource  efficiencies and uptake of renewable energy in the coming years  will play a role in global efforts to mitigate climate change. Highlights that contributed to our strong environmental  performance in 2020 across Tupperware globally are shown  below. Despite certain disruptions in 2020 due to the COVID-19  pandemic, for the most part, our factories continued to operate,  and production volumes were higher in 2020 than in 2019."

See our latest report to  the Ellen MacArthur Foundation here.Our legacy is one of providing durable products for many years  of use, and our kitchenware and food preparation products have  always been designed with this sustainability principle in mind. As such, Tupperware® products offer a path to the elimination of  single-use plastics that has become a global concern. In 2021, following completion of our materiality assessment, we revised our circularity targets as follows: Circularity impacts By 2025  By 2030   Eliminate the use of single-use plastic packaging50%    reduction of single- use plastic packagin g95%  elimination of single-use plastic  packaging Provide opportunity for returned Tupperware® products to have  a new life90% of returned  product will be used as  raw material input for  our own or third-party  productCreate meaningful and innovative  ways to find new life for returned  Tupperware productsTupperware® products have always been designed to provide solutions to the most common kitchen and food   preparation challenges to help make life more efficient, as well as to provide ways to help keep food fresh  longer and avoid food waste."
Tupperware_115,"Our vision as a company is to use our business opportunities and our products to make a positive impact on the world around us. Our  products have always been engineered to reduce environmental impact by providing reusable, durable and easy-to-use solutions that  help minimize plastic and food waste. We extend our vision by committing to significantly reduce waste by taking large steps to ensure waste reduction at every step of our  product lifecycle, from design, manufacturing and distribution, to consumption, recycling and recovery.Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Environment: No Time to Waste 15Made from recycled,  renewable or sustainably  sourced raw materialsAccelerating the pace with ECO+ ECO+: The use of SABIC circular polymer in  Tupperware® products has enabled the avoidance  of more than 100 tons of CO2 emissions from our  product lifecycle (2019-2020) and more than 165 tons  of plastic waste to landfill. During 2020 and 2021, we continued to accelerate our pace of  innovation and consideration of alternatives from a variety of  sustainable, recycled, bio-based and environmentally conscious  materials in order to expand our ECO+ offering to more  products. For example, we have already introduced a renewable,  bio-based polymer from plant-based waste for manufacturing of  our products, with procurement of an initial volume of 174 metric  tons."
Tupperware_120,"Additionally, in 2021, we developed a line of products using  a new circular polymer made from recycled PET bottles (TritanTM  Renew, see below). Transparent circular products using Tritan™ Renew: In  2021, we partnered with Eastman, a global specialty materials  company, to expand our ECO+ portfolio using Tritan Renew. Tritan Renew resin is made with Eastman’s polyester renewal  technology that recycles at the molecular level, breaking down  plastic waste to its fundamental building blocks to be used  to create pristine new material. The material is highly durable,  dishwasher safe, and free of toxic materials. Tritan Renew offers  Tupperware the ability to design clear or transparent products  with 50% certified recycled content  without compromising on  quality or clarity."
Tupperware_125,"Using Tritan Renew, we launched our Clear  Bowls Collection for a completely new sustainable consumer  experience. Our strategic partnership with Eastman allows  Tupperware to further advance innovation and introduce  products that are attractive, functional and environmentally  friendly. Scott Ballard   Vice President and General Manager   of Specialty Plastics at Eastman“At Eastman, we’re pleased to make molecular recycling  a reality and deliver products that reduce consumption,  advance the circular economy, and create value from  waste. Tupperware’s choice of Tritan Renew shows what  is possible today, not just years in the future.”Our current ECO+ product portfolio includes the  ECO+ Straw Set, ECO+ To-Go Cups and now, the  new ECO+ Lunch-It Containers  and Sandwich  Keepers. Our new award-winning Coffee To Go Cup, launched in 2020,  is made from ECO+ material."
Tupperware_130,"It is a cleverly designed reusable  coffee cup, in two sizes, that enables consumers to take their  coffee on the go from home, or buy takeaway coffee (or other  beverages), all the while avoiding the need for single-use paper  or plastic cups. 1 The recycled content is achieved by allocating the recycled waste plastic to Tritan Renew using a mass balance process certified by ISCC. The first innovative material in our ECO+ line was a new circular polymer, sourced from SABIC, a long-time supplier to  Tupperware and a global leader in the manufacturing of sustainable materials. The SABIC circular polymer uses more than  99% mixed plastic waste collected from municipalities that would otherwise end up at incinerators or landfills. Certified to  International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Plus (ISCC) Standards, this new polymer enabled Tupperware to be first  to market with a sustainable food-grade product line while helping to solve the world’s plastic waste challenges and to avoid  significant greenhouse gas emissions."
Tupperware_135,"We will look to source more ECO+ circular polymer from SABIC, following an initial pilot  allocation, and await further scaling of production to help meet our raw material needs.In 2019, Tupperware introduced its planet-friendly ECO+ material to advance a circular economy and offer  climate smart options to our consumers around the world.

Our  consumers loved it and within a week of launch, more than 230,000 Eco Bottles were sold. Globally in 2020, we processed 27.5 tons of raw  material derived from product rejects or returns,  delivering more than 300,000 Recycline products to  our consumers.Tupperware’s own circular brand  Tupperware’s Recycline recycles returned or  damaged products covered by our Lifetime Warranty  from our markets, as well as products that do not  fully meet our quality standards and are rejected  during our production process, to make new non- food-grade  items  such  as  home  storage products. Circularizing our packaging In line with our new targets to eliminate all types of non- recyclable, non-compostable, non-biodegradable, non-reusable  plastic packaging for Tupperware® products for our packaging  at different stages of our product lifecycle, we have started  making bold plans to transform our packaging sourcing and our  packaging processes in our operations."
Tupperware_140,"Early wins include the use of compostable bags made from corn  starch derivatives for the launch of our Eco Bottle in 2021 (see  section: Product Innovation ), and the complete replacement of  plastic bags for consumer-facing secondary packaging in India  (see section: Combating climate change ). Going forward, we will continue to examine the feasibility of  several alternative sources and our ability to secure sufficient  quantities for our global needs. Partnering for circularity  In 2020, we announced a partnership with TerraCycle’s circular  reuse platform Loop, aimed at eliminating waste and greatly  improving the delivery, design and features of consumer  products.Our partnership with Loop was forged to enable consumers  – first aiming for those across the U.S – to purchase products  from leading consumer brands and retailers packaged in  durable, reusable Tupperware® products. In this partnership,  Tupperware® will provide a new packaging offering for Loop  as its first reusable plastic container brand partner, adding to  Loop’s catalogue of reusable glass and metal containers. Due to  the strength, resilience and weight characteristics of reusable  plastic solutions and our vast experience in engineered resin  and sustainable plastics technology, Loop’s brand partners will  have exciting new options to package, store and ship products  to U.S. consumers."
Tupperware_145,"Loop is a global reuse platform that partners with  brands and retailers with the objective of shifting  from a disposable to a durable supply chain where  manufacturers own their packaging for the long term. In this model, consumers do not own the package,  they own the product within. Once used, products are  retrieved, then cleaned, refilled and reused – creating  a first-of-its-kind circular packaging system. Tom Szaky   Chief Executive Officer, TerraCycle and Loop  “We couldn’t have a more qualified partner than  Tupperware to be our first plastics container brand  partner. Their long heritage and knowledge in durable,  reusable product development makes them a valuable  resource to our partners who are looking to improve the  design and functionality of their packaging.”We introduced our first Eco Bottle made from 100% plant-based (wood pulp) certified renewable biomaterial in  18 markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa for World Water Week in 2021."

Tupperware_200,"Following this individual phase, we  expanded the learning to delivering results in effective teams. In 2020, we also introduced TuppTalent, a new process to assess skills and competencies demonstrated by our Associates and  create robust succession planning. TuppTalent also includes an onboarding framework to help integrate new Associates in the right  way from day one. Internships: In 2020, we introduced our Early Talent Identification Program for college students to gain six months of internship  experience by working on large, high-level projects in different departments across the company. Sessions were conducted across  several countries on Zoom, and at the end of the program, students presented their recommendations to managers and a project  review committee at Tupperware."
Tupperware_205,"We expect to maintain this program annually. Maggie Cavalenes Global Communications & PR Specialist and former ETIP“The Early Talent Identification Program provides college  students the opportunity to work on real projects within  the company and create a tangible, lasting impact. By  working with experienced managers, we got a glimpse  at what our careers could look like following graduation. It’s amazing to work for a brand that so many of us grew  up with, and I am grateful to have been offered a full-time  role at the end of my internship!”  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) We have also begun implementing DEI training  across the company in an effort to educate  all global Associates on diversity, equity and  inclusion.

While we have had various DEI-related actions in place for  many years – such as our Associate Resource Groups and  partnerships with local diverse chambers of commerce in  Orlando – our turnaround allows us to refocus those efforts into  a continuously evolving strategy and ensure that Tupperware is  a welcoming and inclusive place for our Associates to work and  grow. Through our comprehensive materiality assessment, “culture,  diversity, equity and inclusion” was identified as a critical and  key area of focus. In connection with this goal, for the first time we established targets to drive improved DEI performance across Tupperware:Global quarterly health initiatives in 2020 included: •  Leading a healthy lifestyle - with a focus on walking for  fitness, managing cholesterol, quitting smoking and managing  alcohol intake • Eye test for all Associates on site free of charge • Know your numbers – vital health metrics, what they mean  and how to manage them • Eye strain education including causes of eye strain, proper  screen practices and eye care tips Other activities at different sites in 2020 included: •  Ergonomics training by physiotherapists focusing on  musculoskeletal disorders at work, prevention and  physiotherapy • Stress management for managers to help them recognize  issues and support their teams • Healthy cooking, eating and nutrition workshops •  Health awareness campaigns on different days during the  year, supporting employees with knowledge and guidance  for care and support, and where relevant, prevention or free  testing options, including: • World Lymphoma Awareness Day  • World Breast Cancer Day (with information regarding free  mammographs)  • World Osteoporosis Day (with information regarding free  bone density testing)  • World Diabetes Awareness Day   • World Aids Awareness Day • TupperWalk program with short walks outside the plant  during breaks and walking meetings   Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 22Safety, Health and Wellness South Africa •  100% attendance of  all plant personnel at  safety training, which  included Lock Out Tag Out  procedures, fire safety,  working on ladders and  forklift operation. •  Recognition for good safety  behavior rewarded with a  Safety Day T-shirt."

China •  More than 4,700 hours of  safety training delivered  across 23 different health  and safety topics. •  Several machine  modifications to improve  ergonomic profiles for  factory operators, for  example, new cap molds  were created to avoid  manual fitting to reduce  hand and arm exertion, and  covers were added to all  potential pinch points on  product conveyors.Helping people stay safe, healthy and well at work is a primary objective for Tupperware at all times and in  all our locations around the world. Investing in Health and Wellness:   Since 2008, our award- winning TupperFit program encourages our Associates to  enhance their lives through personal fitness, health and  nutrition. In 2020, we maintained our focus on staying healthy  during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting our Associates with  multiple global and local initiatives, including virtual programs  to encourage exercise, mental health and stress management."
Tupperware_235,"We comply with all applicable safety legislation wherever we  operate and in addition, we hold ourselves accountable to our  own stringent safety standards and practices encompassing  our Associates, contractors, our independent Sales Force  and visitors to our sites. Beyond safety, we encourage our  Associates to engage in activities and programs that help them  focus on being healthy and well as a way of life, not just at work. Safe Working Practices:  Responsibility for safety management  rests with our Chief Operating Officer who is supported by a  global infrastructure of safety officers and safety committees  at each of our facilities, overseeing safety compliance, risk  management, hazard elimination and performance reporting. They are responsible for safety compliance, assessing safety  risk, helping to ensure hazards are eliminated, rolling out training  to all Associates in the supply chain and reporting performance. All our 14 operating plants around the world compete for our  TuppStar Annual Social Impact Award which recognizes social  impact initiatives, including outstanding safety performance."
Tupperware_240,"Winning teams must demonstrate strong safety performance  including zero lost time accidents and the highest safety ratings across several metrics. Our sites participate in global initiatives  as well as developing creative ways to reinforce a culture of  safety at each site. 2020 was an especially challenging year due  to the additional requirements to keep our Associates safe during                      continued operations through the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety Around the World:  A core annual initiative is Safety  Day, in which all plants participate with initiatives engaging the  entire workforce at the site. This year, our activities were also  designed to energize our personnel, while taking into account  the local social gathering restrictions."
Tupperware_245,"Examples of activities at  a selection of global sites demonstrate the local culture of each  during Safety Day and throughout the year.Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 23Expanding digital tools In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required a rapid shift by the  Sales Force to digital methods of doing business to continue  to reach current and new consumers. While in some markets,  this presented challenges, in other markets, our Sales Force  embraced new opportunities to scale outreach quickly and  efficiently. Throughout this period, we provided extensive  support to our Sales Force with digital tools to connect with  consumers directly through social media, personalized web  pages and online Tupperware parties and administrative  support such as new tools to receive and process orders and  manage personal schedules. We invested in training to support  Sales Force members to help them adapt quickly, with many  moving from no online presence at all to full utilization of  digital platforms in the space of a few short weeks. We believe  this digital presence will remain an important part of our  business model going forward, furnishing Sales Force members  with more choices for doing business and opportunities for  expansion."
Tupperware_250,"Our most advanced digital tool is called TuppSocial, which  makes it easy for our Sales Force to grab and share social  media content to better market their businesses and product  offerings. We have expanded this technology into 23 markets  with more planned in the coming months. We are also rolling  out technology tools like Tupperware Live, which enables our  Sales Force to host virtual parties and allows their customers  to purchase in the moment. We have launched this in 19  markets so far with more countries coming online in 2022. Our  most recent technology addition is an onboarding tool."
Tupperware_255,"It helps  to drive retention and performance and is also where our Sales  Force members can find resources for communication as well  as continued education and training. It has been launched in 2  key markets so  far, with 5 more planned before the end of 2021.Rekha Ramesh, Tupperware’s Chief Digital &  Information Officer, was named a 2021 CIO of the  Year Winner by CGT - Consumer Goods Technology  - a digital media brand as recognition for her work in  accelerating our digital transformation and rapidly rolling  out tools to help our global Sales Force start, grow and  sustain their businesses, especially in today’s increasingly  virtual environment.Enhancing entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship has always been at the heart of Tupperware’s  success. Recently, we have been focusing on delivering our  Turnaround Plan by making it easier for the Sales Force to do  business. For example, we developed targeted approaches to  support Sales Force members in different ways, according to  their motivation: those who want to generate a consistent and  increasing income, and invest in business building, and those  who choose to join the Sales Force to gain product discounts  and other benefits. Patricio Cuesta   President of Commercial Worldwide“In this period of significant change, one thing has not  changed: the tremendous entrepreneurial opportunity we  offer to millions of individuals around the world to build  skills, develop confidence and generate income at their  own pace, in ways that fit with their lifestyle choices and  commitments."
Tupperware_260,"Our flexible model remains an exciting  opportunity and this was amplified during the COVID-19  pandemic when the volatility of typical job markets  prompted more people to join our Sales Force and start to  generating income from day one.”  Our Sales Force While our predominant model has always been direct sales, independent Sales Force members in certain markets own and operate  retail stores and studios, which provide an entrepreneurial opportunity to engage with consumers to demonstrate and sell products  in convenient locations. In China, for example, Sales Force members operate more than 5,600 such stores. As part of our Turnaround  Plan, we will offer additional in-person product purchasing opportunities to complement the current retail store and studio platforms.Tupperware’s success over the years has been powered by our millions of independent consultants in more  than 70 countries, with approximately 534,000 being active at any given time. Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 24Stories from the field We conduct business around the world, and recognize that each region has its own identity, challenges, and  opportunities. In 2020, all of our regions responded effectively to the demands of a new business environment."
Tupperware_265,"North America  In North America, 2020 was one of the most productive sales periods in our company’s  history, due to the convergence of several factors:  •  The COVID-19 pandemic forced many people who had lost their jobs to seek new  sources of income – in 2020, we increased from 30,000 to 50,000 Sales Force  members. •  Lockdowns across the country meant people prepared more meals at home and  took the opportunity to refresh their kitchenware. •  We focused on Sales Force retention with new targeted incentives and support tools  to meet different needs. For example, in June 2020, we introduced the Virtual Kit,  enabling new Sales Force members to achieve preferred discounts without a large  upfront investment •  We continued to innovate and bring relevant, useful, environmentally favorable  products to market. In 2020, our ECO+ range gained significant momentum as well  as other innovations."
Tupperware_270,"Our partnership with the National Park Foundation attracted  much interest. Pieter Swanepoel   Vice President of Global Direct Sales Strategy“One of the biggest challenges  we face is team building in a  virtual environment. I find that  even though our virtual tools  are effective, and have enabled  us to continue to do what we do  well, they can still be somewhat  impersonal. Our business is about  relationships. We need to learn  how to work better within our  virtual platforms in ways that foster  creativity, brainstorming, and more  personal interactions."
Tupperware_275,"I expect that  the future holds a sort of hybrid  approach – in which we continue  to reap the benefits of the digital  environment while gathering in  person to keep our relationships  strong.” South America: Brazil  The COVID-19 pandemic was devastating for Brazil, both in terms of the toll on people,  who suffered sickness and loss of life, and also on the economy, which suffered a  major downturn, with thousands of people losing their jobs. At Tupperware Brazil,  we aimed to support both our Sales Force and our consumers by continuing to offer  products and incentives to help people adapt to new ways of working and living. With  more people working from home, home schooling, and eating more in the home, we  tailored our offerings to provide affordable, energy and space saving food preparation  solutions. We also accelerated our adoption of digital tools, which we had begun to  design prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to enable our Sales Force to reach consumers  in different parts of the country. We are optimistic for the future as we proved our  relevance during the pandemic and expect to leverage this advantage going forward."
Tupperware_280,"“We made a decision very early on  that would benefit our business,  especially in the wake of the  catastrophic circumstances of the  COVID-19 pandemic. We felt that  too many people were depending  on us, even though the easier  option might have been to put our  operations on hold until a return  to regular operations. Instead, we  were bold, and this has paid off in  terms of loyalty, motivation and  optimism that will fully manifest  when we return to a more normal  operating environment.” Paola Kiwi   President of Tupperware Brazil   SUCCESS STORY: Nirma Ourives, a Tupperware consultant in Brazil for over a decade, shifted her approach to business – and life – due to the pandemic. Nirma is a  mother to four children and started her Tupperware business to make extra income – and ended up building a successful career and becoming  a mentor to many. When the pandemic started, she took a course in social media and invested her own time and resources to learn more."
Tupperware_285,"She started using digital tools like Digital Brochure and TuppSocial, sharing products and demo videos, cards, easy and personal recipes and  posting content to encourage other consultants to reinvent themselves. In a few months, following her own unique plan, Nirma went from 200  followers on Instagram to nearly 1,200 and doubled her sales during the pandemic period.SUCCESS STORY: In the U.S., at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our Sales Force members  continued to not only serve their customers through selling Tupperware products online,  but they also supported our Adopt–a-First Responder campaign. With the support of local  communities, Sales Force members like Valerie Lockwood and Kate Murphy in New York were  able to donate thousands of Tupperware soup mugs, filled with a soup package and snacks to  first responders and frontline healthcare workers.SUCCESS STORY: In Italy, Sales Force Unit Managers Paola Anselmi and Laura Luvotto adapted how they sell by turning to Smart Parties, our digital version  of home parties, to keep their businesses running through the pandemic. Both Paola and Laura immediately started online after receiving  digital selling training, tools and tips. After almost 20 years of traditional Tupperware parties, both embraced the Smart Party and were able to  maintain and expand their networks considerably."
Tupperware_290,"Watch Paula and Laura talking about Smart Parties here. Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 25Asia Pacific (APAC) 2020 was a very challenging period for this diverse region. In many areas, internet  access remained limited, and the adoption of digital tools and online work was  slow. Connectivity challenges existed not only for our Sales Force, but also for our  consumers who were inexperienced with ordering products online. Once it became  clear that navigating the COVID-19 pandemic was not a short-term disruption to the  way we live and work, but a longer-term reality, Tupperware APAC embraced the  opportunity for change and took several measures: •  Optimized our procedures and processes to minimize expenses and to help maintain  continuity during the economic downturn caused by COVID-19."
Tupperware_295,"•  Rolled out rapid, comprehensive, tailored training for our Sales Force, and assisted in  setting up our teams with both the tools and the knowledge to succeed in a digital  environment. •  Transitioned to online recruiting and fully virtual onboarding to attract new members  to the Sales Force and give them the tools to succeed. •  Focused our efforts on retention of Sales Force members who saw Tupperware as  a key source of income, while offering attractive incentives to those who were more  interested in gaining discounts and benefits across our product ranges. Overall, we protected the business and continued to serve our customers in APAC. Importantly, the accelerated pace of digitization has also brought new skills to our  Sales Force, which will be relevant going forward, even when in-person interactions  return in a post-COVID world."
Tupperware_300,"Christine Wong   Vice President, Commercial APAC“These past couple of years have  been enlightening for me. We’re  effecting a brand-new way of doing  business and as a leader, I need  to be much more agile and adapt  to the times, and help my teams  do the same. I feel as though we  crammed five years into two! Going forward, we will need to  find the right balance in a hybrid  model, with a focus on personal  interactions on the one hand, and  digital skills on the other.”  SUCCESS STORY: Nor Ezwani Bt Mat Nor @ Zakaria & Azmir Bin Ayub work as a husband-and-wife team in our Malaysia Sales Force since 2012, and during  the pandemic they stepped up to embrace all the digital support and training Tupperware could provide, and regularly held online meetings  to keep their teams motivated. As a result, from a business that was totally offline before the pandemic, they succeeded in moving 40% of  the business online, while more than tripling overall sales."
Tupperware_305,"The team was awarded the rank of Presidential Director, which recognizes team  development and strong sales performance. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Our European region is comprised of diverse markets, cultures and economies. Different countries were at different stages of digital readiness when the COVID-19  pandemic started, but in all cases, a reassessment of priorities and new ways of living  and working was needed. Our response across the region was tailored to the needs of our Sales Force. In Iberia,  we piloted an adjustment to compensation plans to offer more immediate rewards for  strong performance and this proved successful throughout the pandemic."
Tupperware_310,"In Germany,  the most sophisticated market in terms of market development and digitization, we saw  double digit growth in our sales figures, building on an existing [digital] infrastructure. Marco Brandolini   Vice President, Commercial EMEA“We saw some embrace the  COVID-19 pandemic as a call to  action, while others found the  transition more difficult. We have  continued to play to our strengths  and differentiate compensation  to reward strong performers. We  are also seeing a lively interest in  the sustainability of our products. Our ECO+ Bottles and other ECO+  products have been a big hit in  Europe, especially in Germany.”Tupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 26Our Communities Tupperware’s business has always been deeply rooted in our communities around the world, and as a business  based on relationships, we see our ability to engage in our communities and give back as an integral part of our  culture."
Tupperware_315,"All of our sites around the world participate in one way or  another in our giving initiatives, which, in addition to monetary  and product donations, involve our Associates in volunteer  activities in our communities. Some examples of our charitable activity around the world in  2020 include: •  Austria:  We led a product campaign in one of our high sales  months, January, with a promised contribution to “Herzkinder  Österreich”, an organization that helps families with children  born with heart illnesses, based on product sales volumes. •  Brazil: Our teams rallied together to collect and deliver nearly  300 toys for donation to children at a local school over the  Christmas holiday. •  India:  The entire Tupperware India Team actively participated,  promoted and donated to the Zomato Feeding India –Nourish  the Needy program with the objective of feeding 5,000  households. We provided ration kits to 5,730 families in three cities and served more than 600,000 meals, impacting  thousands of families."
Tupperware_320,"•  Greece: Our teams in Greece supported several initiatives  including providing daily lunch for pupils at three local schools  and donating computer equipment for disabled children, as  well as donations to various other causes. •  Argentina: Our teams supported “Banco de Alimentos” to help  reduce hunger and avoid food waste. We donated Tupperware  containers and kitchen accessories to community kitchens in  the food bank network. •  South Africa: Our teams in South Africa continued to  support Boys & Girls Clubs South (BGCSA) Africa for the  ninth consecutive year. BGCSA provides daily after school  and holistic youth development programs to schoolchildren  and has expanded to six Clubs in and around Johannesburg,  reaching 1,800 youth annually."
Tupperware_325,"BGCSA is preparing to open a  seventh club in 2020, with Tupperware’s ongoing support. In 2020, the value of our corporate giving (monetary and in-kind donations) at the corporate and local levels  amounted to $4.24 million. This represents 3.8% of Tupperware’s net income in 2020, which compares very favorably relative to the most  community investments made by U.S. companies (median of 0.91% of net income, from a benchmark of 233  U.S. companies2). 2 Data from CECP: Giving in Numbers, 2020 Edition. https://cecp.co/home/resources/giving-in-numbers/?tid=1398  Community engagementTupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Social: Resilient People and Communities 27In honor of Giving Tuesday on December 1, 2020,  Tupperware additionally donated  50%  of the retail  proceeds from sales of its ECO+ Water Bottles in the  U.S. and Canada to the National Park Foundation."
Tupperware_330,"The National Park Foundation  initiative supports the National  Park Service goal to integrate sustainability practices into park  operations. Our donation will support waste diversion and  reduction efforts in U.S. national parks, which welcome more  than 300 million visitors annually at more than 400 parks and  programs across the National Park System. As a premier partner  of the National Park Foundation’s Resilience & Sustainability  initiative, Tupperware will support efforts to educate, provide  solutions for, and raise awareness of waste reduction and  diversion efforts and best practices for visitors. With high  levels of visitation, the National Park Service is managing  approximately 80 million pounds of waste across U.S. parks  every year. Will Shafroth   President and Chief Executive Officer,  National Park Foundation “Together we are investing in the future of national parks,  helping to ensure that these stunning and meaningful  places thrive for generations to come."
Tupperware_335,"We’re grateful  to Tupperware for their tremendous support for waste  reduction efforts that make our parks more resilient and  sustainable for the benefit of all of us.” Tupperware’s support will focus on critical waste reduction  and diversion needs across some of the National Park System’s  most visited sites to reduce waste in parks and protect  resources for the enjoyment of current and future generations. These priority projects include: •  Water refill stations: Single-use plastic bottles are a  significant source of waste in parks across the nation. To  combat this, Tupperware’s contribution will support the  installation of new water refill stations at a number of  national parks across several U.S. states, including the  National Mall, one of the most visited parks. Tupperware’s  support to the National Park Foundation will result in an  estimated diversion of nearly 10 million single-use plastic  bottles from landfills annually. •  Recycling infrastructure and education: At Great Basin  National Park and Yellowstone National Park, Tupperware’s  support will fund the purchase of new recycling sorting  stations and improve signage to help visitors recycle properly."
Tupperware_340,"These efforts will teach the growing number of park visitors  how to be environmental stewards and how their actions can  keep our national parks green. •  Composting infrastructure: Unused and discarded food  is another major source of waste in national parks, and  compostable materials account for as much as 40 percent  of waste in parks. To decrease food waste, we will support  projects that improve parks composting initiatives, including  the addition of solar panels needed to operate the full-time  food waste-composting program. Grand Canyon National  Park, which welcomes 5.97 million visitors each year,  composting can divert over 1,000 tons of waste from landfills  each year and reduce associated transportation costs.Tupperware and our Associates and Sales Force members  consistently rally together to support our communities around  the world when disaster strikes. Our solidarity takes several  forms, including monetary donations, fundraising initiatives,  product donations, and volunteering."
Tupperware_345,"In 2020, we supported  many communities that suffered devastation, including the  following: •  Australia:  We drove a campaign in February 2020 to give  back to the communities in and around Australia who were  severely affected by the devastating Bush Fires, which burned  for weeks on end. In total, our campaign, together with a  monetary donation to the Australian Red Cross, amounted to  $32,500. •  Lebanon:  Following the horrific explosion in Beirut in August  2020, we donated products valued at $10,000. Our distributors  and sales managers also volunteered to prepare and deliver  lunches (in partnership with the Fattal Group) to families in the  city. View more here ."
Tupperware_350,"•  Mexico: We made monetary donations of more than $4,500  and ran a fundraising campaign that generated more than  $200,000 to support communities in the states of Tabasco  and Chiapas in Mexico, which were affected by severe flooding  and landslides. In addition to the help provided by Tupperware  Mexico, our Associates and Distributors provided clothing and  more than 200 cleaning and hygiene kits. •  Philippines: In support of communities during the Taal  volcanic eruption and during typhoons in the country, we  provided monetary support, product donations and funds  raised through a marketing campaign which added up to a  contribution valued at more than $20,000. Our Associates  also purchased, made and distributed hygiene kits to families  in need.Community solidarity in times of emergencyIn support of our No Time To Waste® strategy, and in recognition that our impact on the planet extends well  beyond the door of our factories, in 2020, we pledged $1 million to the National Park Foundation towards its  Resilience & Sustainability initiative to ensure parks thrive today and for generations to come.Giving for the planetTupperware Brands - 2020 Sustainability Report  - Governance: Action with Accountability 28Corporate Governance   At Tupperware, we believe that our legacy of responsible business forms the foundation for our future success.

During the year, the  Board was intensively involved in our COVID-19 response and  management through the challenges of the pandemic, as well  as in the initial phases of the delivery of our Turnaround Plan,  including multiple executive leadership and structural changes  in the business. In 2021, we welcomed four additional members to our Board of  Directors, each with deep experience that will be invaluable as  Tupperware continues to deliver on its Turnaround Plan.

Karen Sheehan   Chief Legal Officer “One of our core values as a company is that we do  what’s right. We see our compliance program, including  our anonymous compliance hotline, as a critical tool to  help us do just that. In times of significant change, as  we have experienced in the past year, it is natural that  people have questions or concerns, and we encourage  the engagement of our compliance teams and use of the  compliance hotline as a safe channel for communication. Our Ethics Committee values employee outreach and  reporting to understand the varied experiences and  morale, and help us address concerns before they  become compliance issues.”  From a cultural standpoint, to reinforce inclusion and ethical  conduct and encourage greater awareness of the needs of our  diverse teams, in 2021 we provided cultural sensitivity training  for our 100 top leaders in the company, spanning the globe and  all functions.During 2020, our compliance and Code of Conduct meetings  and trainings were held virtually via an interactive video  platform."

The module contains new areas of emphasis such as anti- corruption and anti-bribery. 100% of Associates completed our  mandatory annual Code of Conduct training. Our Ethics Committee, comprising senior executives from  legal, financial human resources and internal audit functions  continued to meet frequently throughout 2020, including  weekly for six months of the year as we were establishing new  processes to tighten our compliance structure and effectively  manage investigations and actions relating to reporting to our  hotline.

We conducted a  survey among 80 leaders in the business in 2020 and analyzed  their inputs to develop a set of top 20 enterprise risks from a  likelihood, velocity and severity standpoint. We also prepared  a geopolitical assessment of the top 40 markets in which  we have a presence. Working with this input, we held several  meetings and discussions to develop mitigation plans and  monitoring processes for current and emerging risks, focusing  on the overall top ten. These include risks relating to: • Product accessibility • Digital transformation • Cyber security  • Supply chain management."

Increasingly, corporations are expected to  be proactive in establishing environment, social and governance  (ESG) standards throughout the supply chain and drive  accountability among suppliers in adhering to these standards. Such an approach is necessary to protect people and the  environment from potential risks of supply chain failures and  also protect business reputation. As such, we seek out suppliers that share our values and at  the same time, meet or exceed our commercial standards."
Tupperware_395,"Our objective is to achieve long-term, positive, partnership- based relationships with our global strategic suppliers while Information security and data privacy We continued our focus on embedding data privacy awareness  and practice to ensure our global businesses are compliant  in the European Union with the GDPR, and with other  applicable data privacy regulations across the world. In 2021,  we implemented a worldwide data protection and privacy  policy that establishes a minimum standard, modeled after  the principles of the GDPR, for the treatment of all personal  information the company processes. We maintain counsel in our legal group that specializes in  global data privacy, and remain up to date with developments  at all times. Data security is part of our basic training program  for all Associates, and we have begun to roll out a global data  privacy training program. All Associates will begin receiving  regular training on data privacy and will be assigned training  tailored to their roles and potential interaction with personal  information."
Tupperware_400,"Additionally, prior to engaging global vendors who  will process personal information on our behalf, we conduct  a review of vendors’ IT security measures to ensure that they  meet certain minimum standards. setting an expectation for our 11,000+ suppliers of goods and  services to respect and uphold our values. New suppliers are  subject to a thorough qualification process, which includes a  risk assessment of a legal, financial, operational or reputational  damage (sanction checks) assessment. The supplier must pass  this screening prior to conducting business with Tupperware  Brands. Our Supplier Code of Conduct binds suppliers to compliance  with and adherence to compliance laws, anti-bribery laws  in the U.S. and Europe, as well as forced labor, child labor,  ethical employment and environmental practices."
Tupperware_405,"In addition,  our supply chain performs due diligence on new suppliers,  including labor and environmental practices, asking suppliers  to self-certify to our standards. Based on our evaluation of the  risks of the activity and the manufacturing location, we may  mandate a third party environmental, social and governance  (ESG) audit, using typically SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical  Trade Audit) 4 pillars standards by an accredited external firm on  behalf of Tupperware. A SMETA 4-pillar audit comprises labor  standards, health and safety, management systems, human  rights, recruitment, entitlement to work, subcontracting and  homeworking, environmental assessment and business ethics. We also rely on reports that can be provided by other third  parties using SMETA or Business Social Compliance Initiative  (BSCI) standards. Where possible, our global procurement  department engages with our suppliers in initiatives to improve  process and engineering efficiencies for product or packaging  design and supply processes."

The disclosures contained in this report  underscore our commitment to delivering  breakthroughs that change patients’ lives  through ethical decision-making and our  core values — Courage, Excellence, Equity  and Joy. IntroductionPfizer 2021 ESG Report4 Letter from our Chairman & CEO To Our Stakeholders  As I reflect on the past year, I am extremely proud of the positive impacts  that our scientific breakthroughs continue to deliver for patients and  society."
Pfizer_5,"By remaining laser-focused on our purpose, we were able to  achieve unprecedented progress in helping to address some of the world’s  most pressing challenges. I also realize there is still more we need to  do, significant inequities that must be overcome, and real threats to our  society and environment that lie ahead. I am confident we can rise to any  challenge, just as we have in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. My confidence is grounded in my belief that Pfizer is fundamentally a  different company today than it was just two years ago. By applying the  lessons learned from our work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and oral  treatment1, and by further embedding Environmental, Social & Governance  (ESG) principles into our core operations, we have transformed the way  we discover, develop, finance, and deliver breakthroughs that change  patients’ lives."
Pfizer_10,"At the same time, external forces transforming societal and  environmental norms, along with our internal commitment to equity as  one of our core values, have reinforced the importance of integrating ESG  into our day-to-day activities. In 2021, we continued to focus on ways to make a meaningful and  measurable impact. Never before has our impact been so wide-reaching  when it comes to the number of patients treated or vaccinated with a Pfizer  product. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion1 patients with our medicines  and vaccines – roughly one out of every six people on Earth. Even when  we separate out our breakthrough COVID-19 products, we treated an  estimated 424 million patients globally."
Pfizer_15,"Our ESG strategy includes six priority areas: product innovation; equitable  access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and  inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Our progress on these  areas is detailed in this report, and we look forward to engaging with  colleagues and other stakeholders to hear how we can continue to enhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer. We also continue  to refine the metrics we use to measure our performance as the voluntary  and emerging regulatory frameworks governing ESG reporting evolve at  the national, regional and global level. Breakthroughs and bold ambition The significance of “breakthroughs” has never been clearer than it is today  as we continue to face COVID-19 variants and as unacceptable rates of  morbidity and mortality from the virus endure. We are unwavering in our  commitment to applying science and the dedication of our workforce to help  end the pandemic and address inequities."
Pfizer_20,"We also recognize that even as some people have received a booster dose  of our vaccine, others are still waiting for their initial dose. We continue to  believe we will more rapidly reach more people with our COVID-19 vaccine  by continuing to scale our manufacturing capacity while maintaining quality  and safety through the last mile. This is coupled with our unwavering  support for multilateral organizations and governments with readiness  programs – including lending our infrastructure expertise – so vaccine doses  can more quickly translate into vaccinations anywhere in the world. These  efforts have helped us remain on track to fulfill our pledge to deliver two  billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle- income countries by the end of 2022, having delivered the first billion by the  end of 2021. We also licensed our intellectual property for the COVID-19 oral treatment  to the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded generic  access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in low-income  and lower-middle-income countries as well as some upper-middle income  countries, accounting for approximately 53% of the world’s population."
Pfizer_25,"I am  proud of how quickly we identified pathways to facilitate more rapid and  equitable access for our vaccine and treatment, respectively, and we will  continue to push ourselves to meet patients’ needs, wherever they may live. Introduction1    Please refer to “About This Report” for explanation about Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA). Patient counts are estimates based on multiple data sources.Pfizer 2021 ESG Report5 Colleagues at our core As we scaled up physical capital to meet the needs of society with  manufacturing and distribution, we recognized we would only achieve our  bold goals if we simultaneously protected and nurtured our human capital. Our approximately 79,000 employees help us reach patients in more than  165 countries. At Pfizer, our policies continue to focus on the safety of our colleagues and  ways to support our people."
Pfizer_30,"We encourage everyone to be their authentic  selves at work and are proud of our new and expanded colleague benefits  and wellness offerings. In 2021, we partnered with Thrive Global, a wellness  and organizational change initiative focused on colleague mental health  and wellness. We also hosted two global listening sessions with more than  500 colleagues to discuss topics including allyship, racial bias, and how to  have difficult conversations with empathy. We believe that ESG is part of everyone’s job at Pfizer: it’s important to  our colleagues, and we have linked performance on our goals to executive  compensation to drive the behavior and culture changes required to  achieve such ambitious and sustainable endeavors. We have set key performance indicators (KPIs) and continue to evaluate  additional goals to track our progress on priority issues and programs like  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and diverse talent attraction,  retention, and development."
Pfizer_35,"As a company with science embedded in our  roots, branches, and leaves, we understand the importance of data and KPIs. Letter from our Chairman & CEO — Continued IntroductionPfizer 2021 ESG Report6  IntroductionLetter from our Chairman & CEO — Continued Bold Moves and ESG Strategies — Working toward a common objective Back in 2019, we launched our Purpose Blueprint (including our new Purpose, Bold Moves, and Values), and it has served as our North Star in becoming the new Pfizer. Our ESG strategy  was aligned to our Purpose Blueprint in 2020, and the close connection between efforts to advance our corporate and ESG strategies and report on our efforts helps accelerate our  progress towards a long-term sustainable growth trajectory. Bold Move 1: Unleash The Power Of Our People We are further building on our inclusive, engaging work environment to  recognize and reward performance and leadership, and empower all colleagues  to bring their authentic, best selves to work for the benefit of patients. Bold Move 2: Deliver First-In-Class Science We aim to deliver first-in-class science by sourcing the best science in the world  and significantly improving our innovation success rate through a focus on the  most promising medical solutions."
Pfizer_40,"Bold Move 3: Transform Our Go-To-Market Model We are creating new solutions to address patient access and affordability  challenges by exploring flexible business models that allow us to reach patients  and improve their health care experience. Bold Move 4: Win The Digital Race in Pharma We are continually exploring ways that digital, data and technology can  accelerate our business, expedite the drug discovery and development process  and enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Bold Move 5: Lead The Conversation We are engaging with policymakers and other stakeholders to advocate for  policies that allow innovation to flourish while helping ensure patient access  to the latest vaccines and therapies – all while communicating the value our  science brings to society.Implemented in 2021, our new Global DEI Strategy and non-linear colleague growth model are helping us champion personal  career journeys in line with our purpose. According to our survey results, 90% of colleagues reported feeling engaged, as  measured by pride, a willingness to recommend Pfizer as a great place to work, and intent to stay, and 92% feel their work  contributes to our purpose. In 2021, we also made progress toward our 2025 opportunity parity goal with a 3.4% increase of  females globally and 3.5% increase of minorities in the U.S. at the Vice President level and above."
Pfizer_45,"Our 2021 end-to-end clinical success rate for new molecular entities represents a four-fold increase from 2015. We began  tracking FDA breakthrough designations as an independent measure of innovation that addresses unmet needs and delivery to  patients as quickly as possible. From 2017 to 2021, 45% of Pfizer new molecular entity and novel biologics license applications  approved by the FDA were designated as Breakthrough Therapies. No single model is able to address access and affordability challenges for all products, which is why we work with a range  of bilateral and multilateral partners to create solutions and help advance health equity. Based on our efforts to proactively  address antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another growing public health challenge that has significant impact across the globe,  Pfizer was recognized as a joint leader in the Access to Medicine Foundation Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Benchmark."
Pfizer_50,"We  were recognized as the industry leader in the category of antibiotic stewardship, which includes strategies to expand access and  ensure continuous supply and appropriate use of relevant products. The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation drastically, and in 2021 we automated 90% of transactions on a baseline  of 100 million transactions annually, exceeding the original goal of 75%. We have embedded the practice of working faster and  leaner in 267 dedicated, cross-functional teams across the company to accelerate innovation and better respond to customer  needs. Digital programs are also enabling us to better engage with patients and healthcare systems and this year we increased  the number of programs to 38 in total. For example, our LivingWith™ digital app provides valuable resources to approximately  90,000 cancer patients and their caregivers."
Pfizer_55,"One of the ways we measure our success is PatientView’s annual ‘Corporate Reputation of Pharma’ survey, which asks more than  1,900 patient advocacy groups in 84 countries to assess pharmaceutical organizations across a range of important activities. In  the 2020 Global PatientView survey, Pfizer ranked #2 amongst the largest 14 pharmaceutical companies thanks to our range  of services and support “beyond the pill” as well as our patient information score, which measures how usable and timely  information is for patients. Pfizer 2021 ESG Report7 Looking ahead Advancing science has never been more urgent or more important to  meet society’s needs in an ever-changing world. I am proud of how our  employees have helped us further our purpose and the breakthroughs  we achieved in 2021. As we tackle future threats to the health of people  and our planet, I am confident that incredible things can happen when  people come together to address a problem."
Pfizer_60,"The future of medicine is happening at Pfizer, and we’re committed  to work together and with our partners to improve health around the  world. Dr. Albert Bourla Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer IntroductionLetter from our Chairman & CEO — Continued Pfizer 2021 ESG Report8 On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank you for your  interest in Pfizer. I am pleased to share with you our 2021 ESG Report. Over the past two decades, we have observed an evolution in how Pfizer  and our stakeholders think and talk about the importance of ESG topics. Today, ESG has evolved into the mainstream, and is factored into Pfizer’s  values, and our short- and long-term strategy."
Pfizer_65,"These topics have become  a growing part of conversations we have with stakeholders  — from  shareholders, patients and colleagues and the communities in which we  operate in and serve around the world. Accordingly, these topics have  become key focus areas for Pfizer and the Board. In recognition of the growing importance of ESG topics among our  stakeholders, the Board more directly and explicitly formalized in 2020  its oversight of Pfizer’s ESG efforts, with the Governance & Sustainability  Committee assuming oversight responsibility of Pfizer’s overall ESG  strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The Committee receives regular  updates from management on Pfizer’s ESG priorities and the Company’s  progress against related metrics and targets. The Committee and  management also discuss potential initiatives to further enhance Pfizer’s  ESG performance."
Pfizer_70,"As a Board, we recognize that diversity, equity, and inclusion are growing  interest areas among our stakeholders. In particular, at the Board level,  we strive to maintain a Board that includes a diverse set of experiences,  qualifications, attributes, and skills. Accordingly, the Board considers a  diverse pool of qualified candidates across several dimensions, including  skills, gender, age, race, ethnicity, background, professional experience,  and perspectives, as evidenced by the addition of six new independent  Directors since 2017.The Board is fully engaged and supportive of Pfizer’s ESG initiatives and  continues to believe that our commitment to sustainability and corporate  responsibility are essential to the Company’s long-term success. We are  proud to share Pfizer’s progress on these efforts in this report and eager to  hear responses and reactions from you. Thank you for your interest on these important topics and we look forward  to sharing updates as we further Pfizer’s efforts."

ESG issues are increasingly a priority to stakeholders, including shareholders. We recognize the impact of environmental issues  on society and public health, and we seek to harness our cutting-edge science to create a healthier, more equitable world."
Pfizer_80,"We  are committed to acting ethically, thoughtfully, and responsibly in all that we do. Guided by our purpose, we are focused on: Our Approach To ESG • Climate action • Sustainable medicines • Resource conservation• Product innovation • Equitable access • Diversity, equity, and  inclusion (DEI)• Continually prioritizing  integrity and transparency  in our businessEnvironmental Social Governance IntroductionPfizer 2021 ESG Report11 Our purpose is more important now than ever, as societal, environmental and economic  shifts impact global health and health equity. In 2020, we laid the foundation to more  intentionally connect our purpose with our ESG strategy in order to better understand  and address the needs of patients, colleagues, partners, shareholders and communities. In 2021, we advanced this work by further embedding ESG throughout our corporate  strategy, business operations, and governance structure. Our Approach To ESG — Continued Enhancing the rigor in the processes and controls used  to govern the integrity of data used in our ESG metrics."
Pfizer_85,"We strengthened procedures, automated controls,  and instituted practices used in Pfizer’s financial  reporting processes with the aim of increasing  stakeholder confidence in our disclosures. Embedding an ESG lens in our assessments of  potential acquisitions, investments, and divestitures. Assessing ESG factors in the business development  process is critical to mitigate potential risks to  Pfizer’s business, reputation, and commitment to our  Purpose and Values, and to better understand the  risk-adjusted value of a business or an asset. Potential  partners need to be ready to stand out not only in  terms of production and innovation but also in the  realms of good corporate governance, environmental  stewardship and commitment to social issues and  community investment. Aligning divisional strategies related to Pfizer’s priority  Environmental, Social, and Governance issues to tell  a coherent narrative about our impact on society  and enhance the rigor around public disclosures."
Pfizer_90,"As  Pfizer expanded its DEI strategy in 2021, important  ESG principles were taken into account and embedded  formally in the governance structure. Our efforts included:  Evolving Pfizer’s approach to financing capital  investments using ESG-related instruments. After  launching the biopharmaceutical industry’s first  Sustainability Bond in 2020, we followed in 2021  by launching a second Sustainability Bond and  establishing a $7 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility,  which included ESG KPI-linked metrics focused on our  long-term corporate goals and annual targets related  to carbon emissions and diversity, equity & inclusion. IntroductionPfizer 2021 ESG Report12 Identifying priority issues and engaging  with stakeholders  Over the past year, we’ve had important conversations with key internal and external stakeholders, including  employees, investors, policymakers, patient advocacy groups, academia, and customers. Feedback received from  stakeholders is critical to validate the results of our priority assessment, which was conducted in the second half of  2020."
Pfizer_95,"We intend to further enhance and systematize the processes by which we capture stakeholder feedback and  consider the optimal frequency of conducting formal updates to our priority assessment in the future. In 2021, for  example, we experienced an increase in the level of engagement we had on ESG-related priority issues with: patient  advocates, employees, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Priority ESG Issues   Our ESG report is one of the primary ways we report progress and communicate with stakeholders. Other channels for communicating progress against  our targets include updates during quarterly earnings, press releases, and direct engagement through meetings and industry association participation. Patient Advocacy Organizations In 2021, Pfizer’s Global Patient Advocacy Team engaged more than 1,800 global  patient advocacy groups across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia  through trainings, workshops and webinars focused on health policy issues,  capacity building, patient centricity and patient education and information."
Pfizer_100,"Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Pfizer has a long history of engaging with organizations advocating for access  to medicines and vaccines, environmental concerns, transparency, and business  ethics. As the COVID-19 pandemic and climate issues remained at the forefront  in 2021, we increased the breadth and depth of communication with NGOs and  coalitions. Among the organizations with which we experienced an increase in  engagement included: Oxfam, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders,  and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Investors Through written surveys and questionnaires, one-on-one conversations, and in  public forums, we significantly increased our dialogue at multiple levels of the  organization. Our Chairman and CEO addressed over 200 investors convened  at the CECP Biopharma CEO Investor Forum and participated in the Morgan  Stanley Sustainable Investing Summit."
Pfizer_105,"We held our first ESG investor event,  which featured a fireside chat between Pfizer Board Director and Chair of the  Governance & Sustainability Committee, Joseph Echevarria, and Rady Johnson,  Pfizer Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer. The event was broadcast  publicly and described how the Board addresses ESG issues across multiple  committees, and how our approach to ESG is integrated with the Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) program, which provides a framework for risk identification  and management. Colleagues 2021 marked an inflection point in the breadth and depth of awareness and  engagement by Pfizer colleagues in our ESG strategy, programs, and reporting. Colleagues were both inspired by the actions taken by the company to address  issues related to our breakthroughs for COVID-19 and other diseases, and  curious to find out what they could do to support our efforts. We raised internal  awareness about our strategic approach to ESG through an enterprise-wide  webinar, as well as conversations led by our Chief Sustainability Officer and our  ESG Head with division leadership teams and departmental town halls."
Pfizer_110,"IntroductionPfizer 2021 ESG Report13 Reporting on our highest priority issues   The priority assessment we conducted in 2020 helped  map current ESG issues and the relative impact  on our business and expectations of our external  stakeholders. Through our analysis, we identified 30  topics, the most significant of which are discussed  in this ESG Report. These have been mapped to our  six ESG priority areas, which closely align to our Bold  Moves outlined in our Purpose Blueprint, as well  as the risks and opportunities identified with our  Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach. Based on the results of our 2020 assessment and  subsequent stakeholder engagement in 2021, we  sharpened the focus of our ESG strategy on these high  priority topics, while also monitoring and managing  the other issues from our assessment. We recognize that our priority issues may evolve over  time."
Pfizer_115,"We will continue to regularly engage with a wide  variety of stakeholders to understand their changing  needs, interests and expectations of Pfizer, and are  committed to adjusting our approach as appropriate.Priority ESG Issues — Continued Integration with our Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) process   The ESG priorities were also informed by our ERM  process, which provides a framework for risk  identification and management, the outputs of  which are reported to the Audit Committee of the  Board of Directors. Pfizer Corporate Audit facilitates  the ERM process in coordination with Legal and  Corporate Compliance and helps ensure that ERM is  integrated into our strategic and operating planning  process. For the first time, ESG risks were integrated  into the ERM process in 2020. We will continue to  further align our ESG, corporate strategy and ERM  processes to enable a holistic view of risks and  opportunities to help protect and enhance value. IntroductionIn 2021, three focus areas stood out as key indicators of the  progress we made against our ESG goals and commitments, as  well as critical external drivers."
Pfizer_120,"The sections that follow highlight our extensive  work across these priorities, leading with our  ongoing ambition to help ensure equitable access  to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. We also cover  the global impact made through our Sustainability  Bond as we further connect our ESG and financial  strategies, as well as Pfizer’s refreshed Global  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, which  applies within our direct operations and beyond.Impact StoriesPfizer 2021 ESG Report15  Impact StoriesFrom the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have  worked relentlessly to leverage our decades of experience  and expertise in development, testing, manufacturing and  distribution, along with our partnerships, to work towards  safe and effective vaccines and treatments for all. As a  healthcare company, we understand human rights to be  of the utmost relevance to our business, given the right to  health’s wide-ranging interconnections to other fundamental  rights. Our responsibility to respect human rights extends  across our entire product portfolio, but the pandemic has  helped create an amplified urgency to ensure equitable  access to vaccines and treatments against COVID-19. Equity is a core value of our company and has been  the north star of our COVID-19 response."
Pfizer_125,"Clinical trial  diversity played an important role in our COVID-19 vaccine  development program, where we ensured that historically  underrepresented participants had access to our COVID-19  vaccine trials, and where we enrolled racially and ethnically  diverse participants reflecting the patient population where  the burden of disease has been higher. It has also driven  our ongoing collaboration with governments and key  stakeholders around the world to work towards fair and  equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines while also providing  our expertise and resources for novel approaches to help  strengthen healthcare systems where greater support may  be needed. We recognize that there is a lot of interest in  every aspect of our work in relation to access to the COVID-19  vaccine and treatment and are grateful for all feedback. We remain open to and welcome partnership for new and  creative ways to reach more people. In order to accelerate our efforts to reach vulnerable  populations, we pledged to provide 2 billion doses of the  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income  countries in 2021 and 2022 – at least 1 billion doses each year."
Pfizer_130,"Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries  are currently home to 75% of the world’s population and  62% of the world’s poor. We fulfilled this pledge in December  2021, with more than 1 billion doses delivered to 100 low-  and middle- income countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Jordan, Ukraine, Dominican Republic, Honduras,  Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia – among many others. As part of this strategy, Pfizer is a proud partner and top  contributor to the COVAX facility, a worldwide initiative aimed  at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by the GAVI  vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness  Innovations, and the World Health Organization, alongside  key delivery partners UNICEF and the Pan American Health  Organization. In 2021, Pfizer worked with COVAX and government partners to enable supply of more than 250  million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,  more than 25% of the total COVAX supply in 2021. The U.S.  Government was a critical partner in this effort, committing to  purchase 1 billion doses at the not-for-profit price to donate  to the 92 COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC)  countries as well as the member states of the African Union  that are not already part of the AMC 92."
Pfizer_135,"More than 200 million  of these doses were delivered in 2021, and the remaining 800  million will be delivered through 2022. Moving at the Speed of Science to Address a Global Crisis Our Ongoing Mission to Help Ensure Equitable Global Access to the COVID-19 Vaccines & Treatments COVID-19 Vaccine distribution showing the 166 countries and territories where Pfizer doses were received in 2021   Pfizer 2021 ESG Report16 Vaccine Distribution and Partnerships We know that it won’t just be vaccines that will help bring an  end to this pandemic, but vaccinations. Country readiness  is critical in ensuring that vaccinations are successful. Based  on our experience working with Ministries of Health and  multilateral organizations during the unprecedented scale up  of vaccination campaigns, we have seen multiple issues when  it comes to supply planning and delivery, including, the ability  to properly maintain product handling requirements, the  availability of sufficient ultra-cold-chain (UCC) and traditional  cold chain capacity, availability of essential supplies such as  syringes and diluent, and resource and training limitations  as well as lower uptake rates due to hesitancy. Without  cold chain support, countries are not able to accept high  volumes of vaccine that allow for robust and comprehensive  vaccination campaigns."
Pfizer_140,"And, without service delivery and  sufficient workforce capacity, vaccines in country will not  result in vaccinations. Distributing these types of products rapidly and at national  scale has no precedent in modern public health, and close  coordination across all stakeholders is critical for ensuring  the success of vaccination campaigns. Continued investment  in readiness efforts in many lower income countries are still  necessary to ensure that vaccines shipped effectively reach  populations. We continue to partner with the global health  community, governments and private industry to address  these challenges. As a few key examples:   • Pfizer and the UPS Foundation are committed to  accelerating the equitable distribution of COVID-19  vaccinations."
Pfizer_145,"The UPS Foundation is donating freezers  to countries that need assistance with building out their  ultra-cold chain capacity, and Pfizer provides guidance  and experience in product supply. Our partnership  leverages innovation in the healthcare cold chain to  move our world forward by safely, securely and quickly  delivering vaccines to areas where they are needed most. • As part of a four-year partnership with Zipline, Pfizer  is supporting an innovative pilot initiative in Ghana,  focused on delivering vaccines requiring cold-chain  storage to hard-to-reach areas using drones. The initial  success of the project suggests that the program could  be quickly expanded to deliver doses of COVID-19  vaccines to remote regions across the world where  Zipline operates. • Pfizer has signed a memorandum of understanding  with Global Environment and Technology Foundation  to collaborate with Project Last Mile."
Pfizer_150,"The partnership  is focused on aligning the supply chain expertise and  technical capabilities of Coca-Cola, a company whose  supply chain is characterized as one of the widest  reaching in the world, with technical expertise from  Pfizer on vaccine handling, storage and administration in  order to improve the availability of vaccines in developing  countries, and, in particular, to those residing in and  around the last mile of the medical supply chain in Africa.COVID-19 Moving at the Speed of Science to Address a Global Crisis   — Continued COVID-19 vaccines arrive in Botswana Pfizer is supporting an innovative  pilot initiative in Ghana, focused on  delivering vaccines requiring cold- chain storage to hard-to-reach areas  using drones Impact StoriesPfizer 2021 ESG Report17 Through our ongoing efforts and initiatives, we remain fully  focused on getting high-quality, safe and effective vaccines  to patients all over the world as quickly as possible to help  end the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer’s purpose is to bring breakthroughs that change  patients’ lives. With the people most in need always in  mind, we will continue to work towards a future where  disease doesn’t win, but science does. We recognize and  are concerned by the complex evolution of the pandemic  and how it continues to have severe impacts on individuals,  families and communities.

Pfizer_160,"This past August, we continued to focus our efforts by reapplying an ESG lens to our  capital raising strategies by issuing a second Sustainability Bond, this time raising $1.0  billion. We followed the same path as we did in 2020, by assembling a cross-functional  team to assess the benefits associated with issuing a second Sustainability Bond. We  leveraged the Sustainability Bond Framework we established in 2020 when we issued the  biopharmaceutical industry’s first such bond, which raised $1.25 billion. Proceeds from  the 2020 Sustainability Bond are being used to help manage our environmental impact  and to support increased patient access to Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines, especially  among underserved populations, and to strengthen health care systems. Proceeds from the August 2021 Sustainability Bond were used to support the research  and development (R&D) expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccine R&D, and capital  expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines."
Pfizer_165,"From day one, Pfizer’s strategy to address COVID-19 has been anything but business  as usual. Our goal has been and will continue to be scaling capacity to provide enough  COVID-19 vaccine doses on an equitable basis to reach all who choose it. On the R&D  front, we considered the social impact of the vaccine in the Phase 3 clinical trial R&D  process, which included a diversity of countries, diversity in race and ethnicity, and  diversity in age categories. Given the impact of the pandemic on people living in  low- and middle-income countries and the need to bolster public health systems, we  believe directing resources towards these COVID-19 investments qualified under the  International Capital Market Association’s Social Bond Principles.

Through scientific innovation we aim to design  more efficient processes that can reduce the environmental impact of our medicines throughout the product life cycle. To support environmental footprint reduction efforts, Pfizer is conducting life cycle assessments (LCAs) across our small molecule, large molecule, and device portfolios. Guided by these  assessments, we are working to define environmental sustainability criteria across the product lifecycle. For example, through LCAs we have determined 70% to 90% of the carbon footprint of our small molecule products is associated with the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical  ingredients (API), while the remainder is attributed to packaging, excipients, and other elements."
Pfizer_305,"Many factors contribute to the carbon footprint of API: manufacturing equipment, number  of process steps, route efficiency and use of higher intensity materials such as precious metal catalysts used in the manufacturing process. Organic solvents commonly employed to allow the  necessary conditions for chemical reactions to progress represent one of the most significant contributors to the API carbon footprint. We continue to evaluate ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products through the use of new technology, application of green chemistry, and solvent recycling and reuse.

Over the last  decade, we’ve been taking a hard look at  our productivity, sharpening our focus, and  implementing changes across dimensions."
Pfizer_345,"From our deep understanding of biology,  doubling down on new modalities, and  efforts to empower our scientists for  critical decision-making, Pfizer’s pipeline— including 89 programs in development  from Phase 1 through registration (as of  February 8, 2022)—reflects the scientific  opportunity brought about by our focus on  improvement. Our approach is translating to results as we  accelerate new medicines to market. We  continue to see improvement in our Phase 2 success rate for new molecular entities  (NMEs) on a five-year rolling average  basis, as it quadrupled from 2015 to 2021,  placing Pfizer among industry leaders. Our  Phase 2 success has also helped us achieve  significant improvement in our end-to-end  clinical success rates. By the end of 2021,  Pfizer achieved a 21% success rate for NMEs  in clinical trials from first-in-human (FIH)  trials to regulatory approval - a fourfold  increase from 5% in 2015."
Pfizer_350,"This positions  Pfizer with the potential to achieve one  regulatory approval for every five new  molecular entities entering the clinic  for FIH trials. Significantly, most recent  successes have been either first-in-class  assets or innovations built on established  mechanisms with novel scientific designs. Additionally, from 2017 to 2021, Pfizer  reduced our FIH to Approval cycle time for new molecular entities by 14% (from  9.4 years to 8.1 years). These reductions  focus on operational activities—including  strategy development, decision-making  and clinical trial recruitment—where we can  impact timeframes and find efficiencies. Pfizer is in line with the industry cycle time  of approximately 8 years, with all planned  development programs targeting less than  7 years."
Pfizer_355,"Our relentless focus on productivity results  in greater social impact as we get more  life-changing medicines into the hands of  patients, and at a faster rate. The critical importance of reducing our  cycle times and increasing our clinical  success rate was evident in addressing  the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered a  breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine, achieving  Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), in  record time with our partner BioNTech,  as well as the Pfizer treatment Paxlovid™  (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets),  which achieved FIH to EUA in less than one  year. By the end of 2021, Pfizer  achieved a 21% success  rate for NMEs in clinical  trials from first-in-human  (FIH) trials to regulatory  approval - a fourfold  increase from 5% in 2015.Pfizer 2021 ESG Report33 We scaled our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing efforts and  processes further, successfully delivering 3 billion doses  worldwide as of February 2022, broadened regulatory  authorizations to include children 5 years of age and up  in several countries–with ongoing studies underway in  younger age groups —and helped vaccinated individuals  maintain vaccine protection through booster doses. We will  continue to follow the science and closely track emerging  variants."
Pfizer_360,"We know there is a great need to provide vaccine  access to more people quickly— especially in low- and  middle-income countries. More on these efforts can be  found on pages 14-17. In 2021, Pfizer‘s oral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid  (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), received authorization or  approval in the U.S., Israel and other nations. Nirmatrelivir  —the 3CL or main protease inhibitor in Paxlovid— was  developed entirely in-house at Pfizer and is the first  authorized oral 3CL protease inhibitor specifically designed  to combat SARS-CoV-2. As an oral medication, it can  be prescribed as an at-home treatment to help reduce  hospitalization and deaths in patients at high-risk of  developing severe illness, as well as potentially reduce the  probability of infection following household exposure to  COVID-19 among adults, subject to clinical success and  regulatory authorization."
Pfizer_365,"We have entered into multiple agreements with countries  around the world, and the U.S. government has committed  to purchase 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid in  2022. In addition, as part of our comprehensive strategy to  work toward equitable access to COVID-19 treatments for  all people, particularly those living in the poorest parts of  the world, Pfizer entered into a voluntary license agreement  with the Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed  public health organization. The agreement facilitates  sharing of intellectual property for the production of generic  versions of our oral COVID-19 treatment, with the goal of  helping to improve access to COVID-19 treatments to 95 low- and middle-income countries. Pfizer is very focused on applying the lessons from COVID  to other programs – a philosophy we call “lightspeed”  mentality. Following the successful launch of the mRNA  COVID-19 vaccine, we took the next steps to potentially  expand the application of the mRNA platform to diseases  beyond COVID-19, leveraging the promise the platform  holds for future breakthroughs."
Pfizer_370,"For example, Pfizer initiated  a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,  and immunogenicity of an investigational mRNA vaccine  against influenza. Beyond the flu, Pfizer plans to explore  mRNA in other respiratory viruses, as well as expand to  develop mRNA technology in oncology, shingles and genetic  diseases. Also within the oncology space, we are continuing  development of elranatamab, an investigational bispecific  molecule for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Although  there are several approved therapies for myeloma, most  patients will inevitably progress, and there remains  a significant unmet need for innovative treatment  approaches. We are advancing the development of  elranatamab as a monotherapy and in combination with  other agents with the goal of improving outcomes for  patients with this difficult-to-treat blood cancer."
Pfizer_375,"In addition,  through an agreement with Arvinas Inc. and the acquisition  of Trillium Therapeutics Inc. in 2021, we are investing in  further potential breakthrough cancer therapies. This  includes ARV-471, an investigational drug for breast  cancer that selectively targets the estrogen receptor for  degradation, and Trillium’s lead molecule, TTI-622, which  targets a key immune checkpoint involved in blood cancers. Additionally, our acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  will allow us to advance development-stage therapeutic  candidates for a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases. We continue to advance new vaccines against  pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, and explore the impact of applying groundbreaking technologies to help  fight other infectious diseases where there have been no  vaccine breakthroughs to date. For example, in 2021:  • Pfizer initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating  the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of its  investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine  candidate for older adults."

U.S. FDA regulatory  policies recognizing breakthrough innovation among new  medicines offer pathways for faster review and approval. Relative to industry, Pfizer’s New Molecular Entity (NME)  and Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals reflect a  greater proportion of breakthrough therapy and expedited  regulatory designations. Between 2017-2021, 45% of Pfizer  NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA  were designated as Breakthrough Therapies compared to  30% of industry Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research  (CBER) vaccine applications approved over the same period. Including other FDA designations involving expedited  review between 2017-2021, 91% of Pfizer NME and novel BLA  applications approved by the FDA achieved one (or more)  expedited designations compared to 66% of industry CDER  and CBER vaccine applications."
Pfizer_385,"A core pillar of our ongoing product innovation work  is our efforts to help slow the spread of antimicrobial  resistance (AMR) – one of the biggest threats to global  health and a threat that has become even more prevalent  during the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of only a few  large pharmaceutical companies still active in R&D of  anti-infective therapies, Pfizer is continuously looking for  solutions that target newly emerging infections. Slowing the spread of AMR requires a multifaceted  approach across R&D, policy changes and reimbursement  reforms, innovative surveillance, and an emphasis on active  stewardship. Therefore, our strategy extends to innovative  opportunities and unique partnerships that help improve  infrastructure, education and access, enable comprehensive  tracking, and expand the R&D pipeline. Pfizer’s recognition in the 2021 Access to Medicine AMR  Benchmark reflects our industry-leading approach to  combat AMR."
Pfizer_390,"In addition to a large portfolio of existing  solutions, we are advancing a pipeline of 13 projects between pre-clinical and marketing approval stages. To  complement our diverse product portfolio, our ATLAS  surveillance program – one of the largest in the world –  provides public access to both antifungal and antibiotic  resistance data, helping researchers and stakeholders  better understand resistance patterns. Equitable Access and Pricing Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines are created to help address  the most challenging diseases of our time in areas of high  unmet need. But those breakthroughs will not change  patients’ lives if patients can’t access or afford them. So,  in addition to driving scientific innovation, we are focused  on developing transformative approaches to access,  affordability and delivery, modernized for the 21st century  and reflected in our pricing methods."
Pfizer_395,"In 2021, an estimated 424 million patients were treated and/ or vaccinated by a Pfizer product1, excluding our COVID-19  vaccine and Paxlovid. In our 2020 ESG report, we included  two metrics – Patients Treated (420+ million) and Patients  Reached (58+ million) through access and affordability  programs. We endeavored to streamline our reporting and  clarify our impact by combining these two metrics into a  single KPI to show the estimated totality of patients treated  with Pfizer medicines and vaccines in 2021. As a result,  the 2020 number is restated to reflect the new approach  resulting in 399 million patients treated in 2020. (See table  for detailed breakdown by distribution channel)."

Patients treated includes Patients Reached, which totaled the estimated number of patients globally who received a Pfizer medicine or vaccine      through an alternate access or affordability program. See ESG KPI footnotes for more details.These figures exclude our COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid. This  figure represent the potential number of patients globally who could  be reached with a Pfizer medicine or vaccine through a program  designed to facilitate access or affordability and traditional delivery  channels, which could be private or public in nature based on the  national health system. These metrics are calculated from Pfizer and  third-party datasets."
Pfizer_405,"Despite contractual data standards, datasets  maybe subject to uncertainty. It is possible that patients could be  counted multiple times if they receive multiple Pfizer medicines  through multiple channels. (there may be overlap with patients treated through Traditional  Channels due to third-party data and methodologies) SocialFor information on access to our COVID-19 vaccine and  oral treatment, see our COVID-19 Impact Story .Pfizer 2021 ESG Report35 To reduce the number of people who cannot afford our  medicines, we are implementing: • Innovative financing mechanisms, including  microfinancing, peer-to-peer lending, subscription  models, flexible payment options and other innovative  payment mechanisms to help reduce out-of-pocket  costs for patients on a sustained basis. • Distribution and delivery mechanisms to simplify the  drug supply chain to reduce “middle-men” and bring  cost savings to patients at the pharmacy counter. • New technologies, such as telehealth applications that  reduce barriers to care and digital wallets with the  potential to pass rebates directly to patients at the point  of sale, reducing out-of-pocket costs."
Pfizer_410,"We set the price of our medicines and vaccines guided by the  value our products bring to patients and society, achieving  the broadest possible access; and with an understanding of  the health systems and environment in which we operate. We partner and advocate with payers, governments and  others in the health care system on behalf of patients to  relieve their financial hurdles and provide access to our  medicines at a cost they can afford. We offer patient assistance and donation programs when  insurance or reimbursement systems fail to provide  affordable access to our medicines. And, building on our  30-year legacy of experience manufacturing biologics, our  robust portfolio of biosimilars offers additional treatments at  potentially lower costs. In addition to programs for patient affordability, we also use  differential pricing models, considering the differing needs  of populations, to advance equitable access by striving to  ensure countries and patients with the least ability to afford  medicines and vaccines pay a lower price compared to  those with higher incomes."
Pfizer_415,"Our tiered pricing strategy also  works within market, where prices are determined based  on the specific circumstances of a given market or region. As part of this strategy, we engage in global commercial  access partnerships with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine  Alliance, through which we committed to supply up to 930  million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by 2027  to infants and young children around the world. We’ve also  invested in Sayana® Press to scale capacity of contraceptive  delivery from 20 million units per year to 30 million. We aim to ensure health systems remain financially viable in  situations where earlier coverage of the newest medicines  is needed for optimal health. We work toward longer term  solutions using flexible payment models, including risk- sharing and value-based agreements."
Pfizer_420,"As of April 2021, Pfizer  was engaged in 10 outcomes-based agreements globally,  with another six in development. Alternatively, to achieve  faster and broader access to our medicines, we have over  150 financial-based agreements currently implemented or in  development in emerging markets. Pfizer’s 2021 score in the bi-annual Access to Medicine Index  jumped to No. 4, up from No. 11."
Pfizer_425,"Our top five positioning was  driven largely by our access strategies in low- and middle- income countries, including policies for proactive access  planning, capacity building and income-tailored patient  solutions. Health Care Infrastructure Pfizer acknowledges that healthcare is more than the  development of medicines and vaccines. Governments, civil  society and the private health sector play a critical role in  facilitating access to health innovations by establishing and  strengthening local healthcare infrastructure.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, our paramount  concern has been equitable and affordable access to  COVID-19 vaccines for all people around the world. We  continued to evaluate regularly the risks COVID-19 poses  to people and adapted our response while engaging with  stakeholders. We have mapped our human rights responsibilities against  our sustainability priorities, and in the coming year and  beyond, will continue refining our human rights work to  more fully integrate considerations around people risks  into our business strategy, decision-making, operations  and partnerships."
Pfizer_725,"We will continue to build relationships,  engage with our key stakeholders, and leverage our work  collaboratively with peers and other partners to fulfill our  responsibility to respect human rights. GovernanceGovernance — Continued Pfizer 2021 ESG Report49  GovernanceGovernance — Continued Accountability Right Incentives Pfizer is committed to long-term sustainability focused on  fulfilling our purpose, responsibly. We hold our leadership  accountable for our societal and environmental impact, and  have implemented a top-down ESG strategy. In 2021, the  Compensation Committee reviewed methods for linking  compensation with ESG performance. Effective for the  2022 performance year, the Committee adopted the ESG  Scorecard, (similar to the research and development modifier  approach) which will be used as a tool to assist in determining  the funding for the annual short-term incentive plan (GPP  program)."
Pfizer_730,"This change to our compensation program will  impact over 30,000 colleagues and leaders, globally. The ESG Scorecard approach will further solidify our  commitment to the ESG initiatives. We believe the metrics  used in the ESG Scorecard are some of the key drivers for our  future success. The specific ESG metrics being used for the  GPP are Percentage of Vice President and higher roles held  by women (globally), Percentage of Vice President and higher  roles held by minorities (U.S.) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. We’re purposefully taking a holistic approach to determine  what success looks like, and how our executives are  rewarded for performance."
Pfizer_735,"We’re proud of the Compensation  Committee’s decision to incentivize sustainability and positive  social impact, contributing to our role as a responsible  corporate citizen. For additional details on the GPP Program, refer to the Pfizer  2022 Proxy Statement.Political Contributions and Lobbying Activities We understand the impact public policy has on our  ability to meet patient needs and provide value to our  shareholders. As such, we actively participate in dialogue  around public policy with lawmakers to explain our  perspectives. We believe the business community has a  responsibility to transparently engage in this space, given  our extensive knowledge, research, and societal impact. Pfizer is a member of various industry and trade groups  that represent both the pharmaceutical industry  and the business community at large to bring about  consensus on broad policy."
Pfizer_740,"In addition to trade group  positions on health care policy issues, we realize these  organizations may engage in a broad range of other  issues that extend beyond the scope of what is of  primary importance to Pfizer’s business. If concerns  arise about a particular issue, we convey our concerns,  as appropriate. We believe there is value in making sure  our positions on issues important to patients, Pfizer, and  our industry are communicated and understood within  those organizations. In December, Pfizer issued a report   outlining the public policy positions of Pfizer and five  trade associations across six areas of key public policy  and ESG significance for Pfizer. The report also compares  Pfizer and the trade associations’ positions and describes  the degree of alignment and areas of misalignment."
Pfizer_745,"Pfizer’s corporate political contributions and lobbying  activities  are focused on promoting the interests of the  patients we serve and our company, without regard to the  personal political preferences or affiliations of any of our  employees, officers, or board members. The company’s  corporate political contributions and lobbying activities  are subject to robust internal procedures designed to  align these efforts with our public policy priorities and  applicable law. The company has an extensive training  and reporting program in place to ensure compliance with  applicable laws and regulations as well as Pfizer’s internal  policies and procedures. Pfizer opposed the events at the Capitol on January 6,  2021, and paused Pfizer Political Action Committee (PAC)  giving to the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying  the election for the first half of 2021. Pfizer also supports  ensuring every American citizen’s right to vote, which is  fundamental to preserving democracy."
Pfizer_750,"Pfizer 2021 ESG Report50 Governance — Continued Board of Directors and Board Committees The Board of Directors is elected annually by the  shareholders. The primary responsibility of the Board  is to represent shareholders and to enhance long-term  shareholder value. The Board elects the chief executive  officer and other members of the senior management team,  and acts as an advisor and counselor to senior management  and ultimately monitors its performance. The function of the  Board to monitor the performance of senior management is  facilitated by the presence of a majority of independent non- employee Directors who have substantive knowledge of the  Company’s business. Pfizer’s Board Committees are integral to the overall  functioning of the Board."
Pfizer_755,"The Board has six committees:  • Audit Committee  • Compensation Committee  • Executive Committee  • Governance & Sustainability Committee  • Regulatory and Compliance Committee  • Science and Technology Committee  Board Leadership Structure In December 2021, following a thorough review by the  Governance & Sustainability Committee, the independent  Directors re-evaluated the Board’s leadership structure and  considered the company’s current operating environment,  alternative leadership structures, a review of peer and  best practices, and investor feedback. The Committee and  other independent Directors determined that continuing  to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO would be in  the best interests of the company and its shareholders as  the company can more effectively execute its strategies, especially during this unprecedented global pandemic, with  a Chair with deep scientific and industry expertise, and  company knowledge. The combined role, coupled with the  strong Lead Independent Director, has enabled the Board  to be responsive to challenges and opportunities as they  continue to arise. Governance of ESG Good governance over ESG for Pfizer starts with the Board  and extends throughout every level of the enterprise. These past two years have shown us the importance of  listening to all stakeholders, learning from our experiences,  and stepping up to lead when society needs us to."
Pfizer_760,"This  commitment precedes the COVID-19 pandemic and has long  been part of our DNA as a company. The Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the  Board is primarily responsible for oversight of our ESG  strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The Committee is  also responsible for considering risks relating to: • The company’s lobbying and political activities; and • The company’s policies and practices related to its  human capital management, which may include culture,  diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity and talent  management. The G&SC receives periodic updates from management on  Pfizer’s progress against ESG goals and future initiatives  designed to further enhance performance. Other Board  Committees oversee elements of our ESG program  associated with their respective areas of responsibility."
Pfizer_765,"For  example: • The Audit Committee, which has primary responsibility  for overseeing Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management  (ERM) program, reviews and receives briefings  concerning risks to Pfizer associated with certain  priority issues (e.g., information security and  technology, cybersecurity, drug pricing, access and reimbursement), including ESG areas. ERM provides  a framework for risk identification and management  which includes risks associated with ESG factors. The  Audit Committee is also monitoring and assessing  Pfizer’s preparedness for potential mandatory  sustainability reporting under consideration by the SEC. • The Compensation Committee collaborates with the  G&SC on responsibilities delegated by the Board  related to human capital management and recently  approved incorporating three ESG metrics into the  annual short-term incentive plan funding for 2022,  which will impact all 30,000 plus participants in this  plan. In addition, ESG factors, including the three used  in the short-term annual incentive plan, are included in  the individual performance goals of many executives  throughout the organization, which will further align  their compensation with ESG factors."
Pfizer_770,"• The Regulatory and Compliance Committee (RCC) has  oversight of quality and compliance risk management  in the areas of healthcare compliance across Pfizer’s  core functions – Research & Development and Medical,  Manufacturing and Supply, and Commercial – in support  of Pfizer’s focus on quality, safety, transparency, and  integrity in pursuit of scientific advancement, public  health and its purpose. GovernanceThe committee’s charters may be viewed on our corporate  website at: Board Committee Charters Pfizer 2021 ESG Report51  GovernanceGovernance — Continued Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with any of our directors, including the lead independent director and the audit  committee chair, as follows: By email: https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/Corporate-Governance/Contact-Our-Directors/default.aspx By mail: Corporate Secretary, Pfizer Inc., 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York 10017 The Board of Directors is fully engaged and supportive of  Pfizer’s ESG program. This year, Chair of the G&SC, Joseph  Echevarria, held a fireside chat  with Pfizer’s Chief Compliance,  Quality & Risk Officer, broadcast publicly, to describe how the  Board addresses ESG issues across multiple committees, and  how our approach to ESG is integrated with the ERM program. In addition, ESG is managed internally by our cross-functional  Sustainability Steering Committee, which advises on key issues  and guides the integration and implementation of Pfizer’s non- financial reporting related to ESG. The Committee is co-chaired by  our Chief Sustainability Officer and ESG Head, and sponsored by  the Executive Leadership Team member leading Corporate Affairs,  who reports directly to the Chairman and CEO."
Pfizer_775,"We encourage all colleagues to contribute to achieving our ESG  goals by understanding our strategy and to apply an ESG lens to  their day-to-day activities. In October 2021, we held an enterprise- wide event to raise colleague awareness about our purpose. This  event served as a call to action to convert that purpose into ESG  impact by advancing our corporate ESG strategy. Board Diversity and Independence Our Board is composed entirely of independent directors other  than our chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, and is diverse, with  diversity reflecting gender, age, race, ethnicity, background,  professional experience and perspectives. Each Director provides  a unique perspective, experience and skill set, that creates an  effective and well-functioning Board."
Pfizer_780,"To help ensure effective refreshment and proactively manage  eventual vacancies on the Board, the Governance & Sustainability  Committee and the full Board consider a diverse pool of qualified  director candidates on an ongoing basis. This process resulted in  the election of six new independent directors over the past five  years, bringing our average Board tenure to six years. Measuring and reporting our environmental, social and  governance performance is key to understanding the impact  of our operations, driving continuous improvement, and  maintaining a transparent dialogue with our stakeholders. We are committed to improving our ESG  performance because it is crucial to our long-term  success as a responsible business and is essential  to achieving our purpose. The key performance  indicators we track are driven by an assessment  of issues of greatest relevance and impact to our  external stakeholders and our business."

We have been working for over two decades to  address this global challenge through three generations of  greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals and other resource  conservation efforts. We are committed to developing and  implementing a science-based climate action strategy and  in December 2020 announced our ambition to become  carbon neutral by 2030."
Pfizer_1005,"In addition, as outlined in our  Climate Change Position Statement, we aim to conduct  robust risk assessments to safeguard resiliency of our  research, manufacturing, and commercial activities and to  transparently report on our progress, risks, and opportunities  aligned with Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations. Governance  Pfizer climate change program is co-led by senior colleagues  in the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) and Legal  functions and is integrated into Pfizer’s operational and risk  management processes as described below. Risk & Operational Governance:  The Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the  Board of Directors provides oversight of Pfizer’s Environment,  Social, Governance (ESG) strategy and reporting and  corporate citizenship matters. The Committee, composed  solely of independent directors, is responsible for oversight  of our ESG strategy, reporting, policies and practices. The  Committee is also responsible for considering risks relating  to the company’s lobbying and political activities; and the  company’s policies and practices related to its human capital  management, which may include culture, diversity and  inclusion, pay equity and talent management."
Pfizer_1010,"The G&SC  receives periodic updates from management on Pfizer’s  progress against ESG goals and future initiatives designed to  further enhance performance.Pfizer’s Global Supply (PGS) Quality & Compliance Committee  (PGS QCC) reports key risks, including those related to  climate change, to the Executive Compliance Committee of  Pfizer’s Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO, and  to the Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the Board  of Directors. The PGS QCC risk management process also  informs Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Pfizer’s ERM program provides a framework for risk  identification and management of significant risks,  including risks related to climate change and the long- term sustainability of the business. Each risk is assigned to  a member or members, as appropriate, of our Executive  Leadership Team. The Audit Committee of the Board of  Directors, composed solely of independent directors, has  primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizer’s ERM program."
Pfizer_1015,"Periodically, the Regulatory and Compliance Committee  and the Audit Committee hold joint sessions to discuss risks  relevant to both committees’ areas of risk oversight, including  an annual discussion of the ERM program. The board is kept  informed of its committees’ risk oversight and other activities  through reports by the committee chairs to the full board. More information on the risk assessment process for climate  change is provided in the risk assessment section below. Manufacturing at our internal network of sites, managed  by PGS, accounts for over 70% of the company’s energy  consumption and GHG emissions. The Executive Vice  President (EVP), Chief Global Supply Officer leads Pfizer’s  manufacturing and supply chain and serves as the executive  sponsor of climate change risk management and has  operational control over PGS operations and strategy,  including operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expense  (CAPEX) investment in emission reduction projects."
Pfizer_1020,"Environmental sustainability has been integrated into Pfizer’s  business strategy and GHG emissions reduction is monitored  as a key performance indicator.ESG Governance:    Pfizer’s Sustainability Steering Committee, co-chaired by the  Chief Sustainability Officer and ESG Lead, provides formal  oversight and an accountability mechanism for ESG (including  climate)-related risks and opportunities and is responsible  for ESG strategy implementation. The Sustainability Steering  Committee reports on priorities and progress to the Board  of Director’s Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC)  which provides oversight of the Company’s environmental,  social and governance strategy and reporting, and corporate  citizenship matters. Risk Assessment  Pfizer assesses climate change risk as part of our Enterprise  Level EHS & Business Continuity Risk Management Process. Under this process, we conduct Operational Risk Evaluations  (OREs) which are structured evaluations of risks with the  potential to have substantive impact to Pfizer. The process  determines the effectiveness of controls in place to manage  or mitigate risk."
Pfizer_1025,"Climate change risk is evaluated by a team that includes  relevant program leaders and subject matter experts from  EHS and Business Resilience, Engineering, Compliance, Legal,  and Audit. The Climate Change ORE is designed to assess  potential risk to Pfizer across four risk factors, including:  External/Reputational, Physical, Regulatory/Legal, and Market  & Technology Risks. Individual risks across each of the  four risk factors are evaluated and rated based on severity,  vulnerability, and risk to Pfizer with the goal to ensure that  sufficient controls are in place to effectively mitigate climate  change risks and prevent material impact to Pfizer. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report AppendixPfizer 2021 ESG Report77 Using the ORE, we assess risk factors based on severity and  vulnerability as measured by effectiveness of management  controls. We define high severity as loss of the capability  to produce products as the result of extensive damage,  shut-down, or substantial loss of operations."
Pfizer_1030,"We define high  vulnerability as weak management controls that are not as  robust as would be reasonably expected across multiple  layers, suggesting increased potential for significant failure  of risk control. The higher the severity and the vulnerability,  the higher we define overall risk. Based on the risk scores, we  prioritize action. Of the TCFD categories of climate risks, we  have determined the most significant potential threat to our  operations is physical risk. Pfizer uses tools such as Swiss Re CatNet to monitor  short-, medium- and long-term physical threats to internal  operations and for more than 5,000 contract manufacturers  and material suppliers."
Pfizer_1035,"Risks identified through these  assessments are reviewed as part of the ORE, and mitigation  of risk is monitored through Pfizer’s Business Resilience  program and escalated to company leadership as needed to  inform business strategy. Acute and chronic physical risks related to climate change  are managed through Pfizer’s Insurance and Business  Continuity teams at the enterprise and local levels. Members  from those teams participate in the risk review process that  addresses business continuity/resiliency and provide input  on the potential impact of physical risks that may be related  to climate change, including severe weather events and  flooding. Reputational risks are managed through our process to  transparently disclose information related to our climate  action program and engage with key stakeholders to help  lead the conversation on voluntary actions companies can  take to address their GHG emissions. Regulatory risks are managed through regulatory  development tracking and analysis enabled by our Legal and  Global EHS teams."
Pfizer_1040,"Market and technology risks are monitored and managed  through our Global EHS & Business Continuity risk  management process. Pfizer’s integration of climate change into divisional and  enterprise risk management processes includes reviewing  risks that could be material to the company to support SEC  10-K reporting. Risks and opportunities identified through our assessment  process are summarized in the table below. Refer to our 2021  CDP Response for additional detail on how climate-related  risks have impacted our business, strategy and financial  planning. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report — Continued AppendixPfizer 2021 ESG Report78 Increases in operating costs due to introduction  of carbon pricing/taxation schemes (short and  medium term)  Failure to meet stakeholder expectations  Reductions in operating costs resulting from  efficiency improvements (short and medium term)Risk or opportunity Potential impact How managed  Carbon pricing has emerged as a key policy mechanism to reduce GHG emissions and curb the  impacts of climate change."
Pfizer_1045,"The number of jurisdictions with carbon pricing policies is increasing,  with over 60 carbon pricing initiatives in place or planned by regulators as of 2021. The World  Bank’s “High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness” report suggests that a  carbon price of $50 - $100 / tCO2e will be required to achieve RCP 2.6 by 2030. Although not financially substantive to our operations at this time, carbon pricing could  potentially impact Pfizer’s global operations. Of the countries that have not implemented carbon  taxes/pricing, the United States (US) represents the area of greatest potential impact to Pfizer. Operations in the US represent approximately two-thirds of Pfizer’s scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions."
Pfizer_1050,"If the US implements a federal carbon pricing scheme aligned with World Bank recommendations,  the cost to Pfizer could range from approximately $28 million to $73 million annually by 2030  based on current scope 1 and 2 emissions Pfizer is seeing an increase in requests for environmental performance data and GHG emissions  reduction commitments from customers and investors. For example, England’s National Health  Service (NHS) (which purchases Pfizer medicines and vaccines) has publicly declared its intention  to stop purchasing from suppliers that do not meet or exceed the NHS commitment to net zero by  2030. Pfizer’s commitment to ambitious climate action may help us to retain or increase revenue  by meeting these demands. Alternatively, failure to meet current climate commitments and/or  to continue taking ambitious climate action could result in the loss of market share, shareholder  investments, or otherwise negatively impact Pfizer’s reputation. As a global company, Pfizer operates in multiple jurisdictions with current, pending, or potential  future carbon tax and carbon cap and trade schemes."
Pfizer_1055,"Fuel and energy costs have the potential  to increase in these regions. By implementing energy conservation projects, Pfizer can reduce  exposure to increasing energy costs. We currently achieve annual savings of approximately $3-5  million through the implementation of emission reduction projects. These projects typically have  a payback period of 4-10 years or less and have a lifetime greater than 6 years.To mitigate the impact of carbon fees, including increases in the cost of  goods within our supply chain, Pfizer continues to focus on energy demand  reduction through our internal and supply chain GHG emission reduction goals  (recognized through the Science Based Targets initiative). Pfizer has committed to ambitious targets approved by the Science Based  Targets initiative as aligned with a 1.5⁰C trajectory."
Pfizer_1060,"We are committed to  becoming carbon neutral across internal operations by 2030 by reducing scope  1 and 2 emissions 46 percent from a 2019 baseline, purchasing 100 percent  electricity from renewable sources, and addressing any remaining emissions  through carbon credits. Recognizing that Pfizer’s value chain emissions account for approximately 80%  of our carbon footprint, we are using our influence to catalyze action from  our suppliers. We have integrated environmental criteria across our supplier  sourcing, contracting, and performance management processes and are asking  our suppliers to set science-based GHG emission reduction goals by 2025. We are also using scientific innovation to reduce the environmental impact of  our medicines. We are currently working to define environmental sustainability  criteria across the product life cycle and plan to establish public sustainable  medicine targets in 2022."
Pfizer_1065,"Pfizer’s Environmental Sustainability and Impact Reduction Standard requires  all sites to develop a systematic approach to conserve energy and improve  efficiency. Sites identified as medium and large energy users are required to  establish environmental sustainability teams and to develop and maintain  sustainability master plans that include prioritized emission reduction  opportunities. Project implementation is monitored at the corporate level with  performance reports provided to company leadership quarterly. Pfizer invests  an estimated $25-40 million each year to reduce energy demand through  asset replacement, efficiency improvements, and installation of renewable  technologies. Transition Risks and Opportunities Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report — Continued AppendixPfizer 2021 ESG Report79 Increased need for medicines that treat climate- related diseases (medium and long term) and  increased revenues through demand from new  and emerging markets as disease patterns shift  (short term)  Reduced revenue and potential impact on the  supply of medicines and vaccines resulting from  disruption caused by climate-related severe  weather events (short, medium and long term) Risk or opportunity  Risk or opportunity Potential impact  Potential impact How managed  How managed As global average temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events increase there will  likely be an increase and/or geographical shift in the need for medicines, vaccines, and associated  research and development."
Pfizer_1070,"Climate change presents risks to our operations and those of our suppliers, including the  potential for property damage, business interruption, and/or loss of stored product as a result of  more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges. The potential loss  that could reasonably be expected is challenging to quantify and predict given the number of  variables but could range from $20 million to $400 million based on facility and product values. As a biopharmaceutical company we are uniquely positioned to help address  the global health challenge that is the result of climate change. We evaluate  our current product portfolio against diseases that are exacerbated by climate  change to identify medicines and vaccines potentially responsive to this global  health challenge, such as treatments for various vector and waterborne  diseases. With an extensive portfolio and expansive geographic reach, we have  been able to consistently meet the diverse needs of, and provide significant  value and impact to, patients and health care professionals around the world in  an innovative, socially responsible and commercially viable manner."
Pfizer_1075,"Pfizer has implemented business continuity programs to ensure our physical  operations and supply chains are taking steps to mitigate the risk and potential  impact of interruption. We have completed an assessment of physical risk for  all our manufacturing facilities and for over 5,000 of our suppliers using climate  modeling scenarios predicting temperature increases ranging from 0.2⁰C to  3⁰C. For our internal manufacturing sites, the output of this analysis supports  decisions related to business continuity and recovery planning at the sites. Pfizer’s Loss Prevention and Business Continuity programs identify potential  supply chain vulnerabilities and establish contingency plans to maintain  supply, e.g., alternative sourcing options and holding multiple weeks of buffer  inventory (depending on product).

We remain committed  to ambitious long-term actions and have announced our  ambition to become carbon neutral across our internal  operations, procuring 100% renewable electricity and  delivering a 46% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2  emissions from a 2019 baseline. Any remaining emissions will  be offset through carbon credits. Additionally, recognizing  that Scope 3 emissions account for 80% of our carbon  footprint, we also commit to reducing emissions related to  upstream logistics by 10% and business travel by 25% by 2025  from a 2019 baseline, and to use our influence to catalyze  similar reductions across our value chain."

Carrefour_10,"The progress of Carrefour’s ESG  performance is tracked, in particular,  through the evolution of our CSR and  Food Transition Index , a comprehensive  and detailed index composed of 17 key  performance indicators and targets ,  the performance of which is measured  annually, disclosed in our Universal  Registration Document (“URD”) and  audited annually by an independent  third party (for more information please  refer to section 2 “Corporate social  responsibility and performance” of our  URD, available at www.carrefour.com). In 2019, the Group reiterated its  ambition to become the leader of the  food transition for all , by adopting its  ""raison d’être"". Carrefour’s position as a leading global  retailer gives it a unique ability to pursue  transformative change across the supply  chain and lead industry-wide action to  tackle some of the biggest social and  environmental challenges facing us  today. With a multi-format network  of some 13,000 stores in more  than 30 countries, the Carrefour  Group is one of the world's  leading food retailers. It has  more than 320,000 employees  who help to make Carrefour  the world leader in the food  transition for everyone,  providing customers access to  high-quality, affordable food  every day."

SUSTAINABILITY  STRATEGY In January 2018, Carrefour launched,  under the leadership of Alexandre  Bompard, its five-year transformation  plan, ""Carrefour 2022""  in order to  respond to identified global challenges  by becoming the leader in the  food transition for all. The objective  of Carrefour's business model  transformation is to promote healthier,  accessible food, while committing  to the agricultural transition and the  preservation of the planet's resources. 2.2. CARREFOUR’S APPROACH  FOR LEADING ON THE FOOD  TRANSITION FOR ALL  The Group’s CSR methodology has  evolved significantly due to the actions  taken in implementing the “Carrefour  2022” transformation plan."
Carrefour_20,"The  methodology is based on the following  principles:  $ Transparent goals with stakeholders  supported at the highest level of the  organisation:  Carrefour works with its  partners in setting specific, quantitative  targets. The Group presents its short  and long-term goals in line with material  issues identified with its stakeholders. The Group’s objectives associated  with CSR and the food transition are  measured through a set of performance  indicators. The most strategic objectives  are integrated into the CSR & Food  Transition Index. This index measures  an achievement rate, which is also a  criterion factored into management  compensation."
Carrefour_25,"$ Dedicated governance:  Governance  bodies for CSR and the food transition  have been set up at every level in the  organisation. The Group has created  an external Food Transition Advisory  Committee, which is chaired by Alexandre Bompard. Internal food  transition advisory committees were set  up at Group level in integrated countries  and within the various professions  depending on the issues addressed. $ Actions for its customers  integrated into products and stores:   The integration of actions tested by  customers into stores is a key marker  of the methodology, as these actions  embody the Group’s long-term  objectives. To achieve its mission of becoming  the leader of the food transition, the  Group acts at all levels to participate in  transforming markets; directly engaging  suppliers, partners, and customers; and  bringing innovative solutions that can  reshape production and consumption  modes."
Carrefour_30,"Carrefour uses the following  drivers to make this mission a success:$ Working towards a positive  transformation in market standards:   Carrefour acts for progress in market  standards through initiatives supported  by retail companies, suppliers and  stakeholders in the value chain,  organisations and public authorities. These coalitions come together to  facilitate market transformation by  collectively shaping practices and  bringing about large-scale changes,  which can sometimes anticipate new  regulations. The Group also takes part  in different working groups to identify  emerging solutions and co-build action  plans at a collective industry level. $ Implementing exclusive initiatives  at a local or international level  that  serve as an industry benchmark and  can change consumer standards. Initiatives that have been successful with  consumers are applied industry-wide  Carrefour SA has also included the  following mission in its by-laws: ""Our mission is to provide our  customers with quality services,  products and food accessible to  all across all distribution channels."
Carrefour_35,"Thanks to the competence of our  employees, to a responsible and  multicultural approach, to our  broad territorial presence and to  our ability to adapt to production  and consumption modes, our  ambition is to be the leader of the  food transition for all. ""SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE  PART 28  I  CARREFOUR GROUP SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED BOND FRAMEWORK I  9and help bring about transformation on  the market. Campaigns include “ C’est  qui le patron ? ” (Who’s the Boss? ), “Bring  your own bag”, returnable packaging,  no-waste boxes, and the elimination of  plastic from the fruits and vegetables  section."
Carrefour_40,"Carrefour and its partners work  to identify innovative solutions, support  the implementation of these solutions  and, as such, suggest new ways of  producing and using products. $ Getting direct suppliers and  partners involved:  Carrefour has direct  relationships with thousands of farmers,  manufacturers and service providers: -  The Group uses its trade relations,  especially with its suppliers of  Carrefour-brand products, to include  standards in line with CSR and the food  transition. In 2020, Carrefour updated  its purchasing rules to support the  food transition, for example including  criteria and requirements to respect  marine resources, protect forests,  integrate ecodesign into packaging  and promote agroecology. -  Carrefour sets up voluntary  collaborations with its suppliers of  Carrefour-brand products and national  brands to initiate the transformations  necessary to bring about the food  transition for everyone. For instance,  Carrefour offers its suppliers  opportunities to work on joint projects  (e.g., Collaboration for Healthier  Life in Lyon), innovation platforms  (e.g., RESET project for ecodesign  in packaging) and technical support  for supply lines (e.g., development  of agroecology in Carrefour Quality  Lines)."
Carrefour_45,"Finally, the Group launched the  Food Transition Pact in 2020, which  unites national brand suppliers around common objectives on biodiversity,  transparency, health and nutrition,  climate and packaging. $ Educating and engaging customers:   To transform consumer habits, Carrefour  offers products and solutions in stores to  promote sustainable consumption. This  enables Carrefour to identify and better  meet customers’ emerging societal and  environmental expectations. But the  Group also hopes to educate people  about sustainability issues and co-build  solutions that everyone can adopt. Carrefour also established customer  consultation and engagement channels  to define its strategies (for example,  activist consumer groups in Spain and  France)."
Carrefour_50,"Carrefour uses analysis and dialogue  tools to identify material issues, and  to define its policies and action plans  while taking a continuous improvement  approach. The Group implements the  following actions, which are detailed in  other sections of this document: -  engaging with stakeholders and  consumers on societal issues;  -  defining policies and helping the  business segments to deploy action  plans and achieve objectives;  -  risk analysis and materiality analysis;  -  and evaluating non-financial  performance.2.3. CARREFOUR’S CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE UNITED  NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) Carrefour's business model aims at creating value for its stakeholders and generating  a positive impact on society. Carrefour's mission is to offer its customers quality  services, products and food accessible to all through all distribution channels.

CLIMATE CHANGE $ Context and definition In 2015, the COP21 Paris climate  agreement set goals for limiting global  warming, advocating reorientation of the  world economy toward a low-carbon  model and the phase-out of fossil fuels. This sets a major challenge for large- scale retail, whose environmental impact  extends not only to the actual stores but  through the entire logistics chain, from  production site to the customer’s home. At its Shareholders’ Meeting of May 29,  2020, Carrefour announced new goals,  approved by the Science Based Targets  initiative, a partnership between the  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the UN  Global Compact, the World Resources  Institute (WRI) and the WWF®."
Carrefour_65,"Carrefour has been certified, along  with more than 800 other companies,  in light of its commitment  to keeping  the global temperature increase to  below 2°C by 2100 compared to pre- industrial temperatures . The Gro up has evaluated its greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions accordingly:  -  97% fall into scope 3 (indirect emissions,  from activities upstream of Carrefour  itself, as opposed to scopes 1 and 2,  direct emissions);  -  76% of the Group’s scope-3 emissions  are from products and packaging sold  in stores;  -  and 12% from the use of fuel sold. Carrefour experiences a number of  risks and opportunities arising from  climate change. To start with, regulatory  pressure incites stores to achieve  greater energy efficiency. Second, there  is the physical risk of extreme climate  events, such as flooding, hail and snow,  damaging roofs that were not designed  to undergo them."
Carrefour_70,"Then we have the  fact that new consumption habits (such  as a preference for local produce or  organic food), deriving from concern  on environmental protection, will exert  an increasing influence on purchase  decisions and Group preferences. $ Policy and performance Scope 1 and Scope 2:  Carrefour has  set itself the goal of achieving a 30%  reduction in its GHG by 2030 and a  55% reduction by 2040, compared  to 2019. In-store consumption of gas,  electricity and refrigerants are the main  contributors to the Group's total direct  greenhouse gas emissions. To meet these targets, Carrefour pledges  to focus on:  -  cutting energy consumption, -  increasing the proportion of renewable  energies in power consumed,  -  reducing refrigerant-related CO2  emissions by 2025 compared to 2010, by phasing out hydrofluorocarbon  (HFC) gas refrigerants and limiting  refrigerant leaks; Scope 3: Carrefour has set itself the  goal of achieving a 29% reduction in  its indirect GHG emissions (scope 3)  by 2030, compared with 2019. In view of its main indirect emissions  drivers, Carrefour has structured its  Climate Action Plan around three  priority areas that together account for  90% of scope 3 emissions:  -  purchases of goods and services:  reducing emissions from goods and  services purchased by 30% by 2030,  compared with 2019 (well below  the 2°C scenario)."
Carrefour_75,"This target means cutting 20 megatonnes of CO2  between 2030 and 2019;  -  product use: reducing emissions  from product use (especially for fuel  and consumer electronics) by 27.5%  by 2030, compared with 2019 (2°C  scenario);  -  outbound transport: reducing CO2  emissions linked to outbound transport  by 20% by 2030, compared with 2019  (2°C scenario). 500 0001 000 0001 500 0002 000 0002 500 0003 000 0003 500 000 0 2010361 476 335 961 342 636 337 224 239 8453 009 535 2 031 1381 830 5391 663 797 1 281 377 -20% vs 2019-30% vs 2019 2018 2019 2020 2030Total Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions (Only transport is reported here, the Group is working to develop a methodology of reporting of the emissions linked to the products) $ Joint initiatives and partnerships: -  Signatory to the French Business Climate Pledge -  Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) network -  Science Based Target Initiative (SBT) -  Climate Disclosure Standard Board (CDSB) -  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) - Reporter Services  Membership -  Food Transition Pact For more detailed  information on the  action plan, please  refer to our URD.14  I  CARREFOUR GROUP SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED BOND FRAMEWORK I  15 PART 2 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE 2.6. CIRCULAR ECONOMY DEVELOPING ECODESIGN AND  A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR  PACKAGING $ Context and definition More than 350 million tonnes of plastic  are produced each year worldwide,  with 40% for packaging. And the figure  is constantly on the rise. Because  packaging is considered throw-away  by nature and of low cash value, and  because collection infrastructures are  not highly effective, the environmental  impact is very considerable, as we  can see with the proliferation of waste  plastic in the ocean."
Carrefour_80,"The rise in packaging volumes is closely  linked to the boom in large-scale retail:  packaging facilitates goods transport,  extends product conservation and helps  consumers identify product differences. If major retail is responsible for the  emergence of large quantities of single- use packaging, it is also ideally placed  to bring about the necessary changes  in packaging practices, especially in the  light of growing consumer awareness  on the issue. Carrefour wishes to spearhead a retail  industry transition toward a more  reasonable and measured consumption  of packaging, by working alongside  its rivals to promote the innovations  eco-designs of product and packaging  suppliers, by raising consumer  awareness on the matter, and by  partnering with NGOs in the field. An  initial analysis covering 800 suppliers  in 2018 estimated the yearly amount  of Carrefour own-brand packaging at  more than 120,000 tonnes. Concerted  involvement across the entire Carrefour  ecosystem is needed to address  this issue and smoothly bring in the  necessary changes."
Carrefour_85,"Consumers are getting behind the  efforts undertaken: according to  a comparative study by Alkemics  OpinionWay, although the health crisis  has resulted in a slight decline in the  relative importance accorded to this  issue, it still remains highly relevant  and topical.

The cost of wasting farming produce  (excluding fish and seafood) is estimated  at 750 billion dollars per year worldwide."
Carrefour_95,"In environmental terms, food waste  accounts for the release of 3.3 Gt of  greenhouse gases per year, making it  the third biggest polluter in the world,  after the United States and China. Food waste has a number of causes:  overproduction, calibration criteria,  interruption in the cold chain, poor  stock management, supply-demand  mismatching, etc. In France, 32%  of food waste is generated at the  agricultural production stage, 21% at the transformation stage, 14% at the retail  stage, 14% at restaurants and in catering,  and 19% in domestic consumption (2). At each step in the farming and food  chain, there are measures to be taken  on cutting down waste In 2018,  Carrefour evaluated food waste  throughout the value chain, from the  farm to the consumer’s table, for five of  its best-selling fresh products: avocados,  cod, carrots, bread and chicken. This  evaluation yielded a number of solutions  throughout the value chain: crop  growing & harvesting, sorting, packaging  & transport, quality control, distribution  and consumption."
Carrefour_100,"These solutions  could eventually be rolled out across all  the products sold by Carrefour. Cutting down on food waste is a  major challenge for Carrefour, both for  shrinking the environmental footprint  $ Joint initiatives and partnerships: -  Consumer Goods Forum  -  Too Good To Go pact: bringing together industry, retail, NGOs, trade organisations  and digital operators in the fight against food waste$ Policy and performance Carrefour shares the Consumer  Goods Forum (CGF) goal of achieving  a 50% reduction in food waste by  2025 (compared to 2016). Carrefour’s  global policy on cutting down food  waste has three focus areas: in-store  measures, cooperation with suppliers,  and consumer education. Carrefour’s  ambition is to ensure operational  excellence in its own waste reduction  and to catalyse action among  stakeholders (suppliers and consumers)  throughout its business ecosystem.of its activities and for improving  operational efficiency. Methods such  as discount management for products  nearing the sell-by date and recovery of  unsold produce open opportunities for  cutting down waste."
Carrefour_105,"This global issue took on a whole new  dimension in 2020 as the health crisis  worsened the situation of vulnerable  people and low-income households. It became even more important to cut  down on the amount of perfectly healthy  and nutritious food being wasted so that  it could be given to the most deprived.

Carrefour_110,"The Carrefour Foundation, which  celebrated in 2020 its twentieth birthday,  has encouraged and funded numerous  sector-based and local stakeholders  committed to promote sustainable  agricultural practices, in France, in the  8 other integrated countries of the  Carrefour Group (Argentina, Belgium,  Brazil, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania and  Taiwan) and around the world.Carrefour actively contributes to  agricultural food transition projects and,  more generally, to numerous initiatives,  such as combating food waste, energy  consumption and the overall impact of  its operations on climate change (for  more information please refer to section  2 “Corporate social responsibility and  performance ” of our URD, available on  www.carrefour.com). In 2018, Carrefour  launched "" Je Participe "" - crowdfunding  and crowd-lending platform - enabling it  to invest in local agricultural projects in  line with the Food Transition alongside  with its customers.In June 2019, Carrefour amended  and extended two credit facilities,  incorporating an innovative Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) component  in the first CSR-linked credit transaction  in the European retail sector. As part  of these credit facilities, an investment  structure dedicated to the food transition  for all has been put in place, funded by  Carrefour and the banks, depending on  the evolution of Carrefour's CSR & Food  Transition Index. The related sums are  used to finance “Act for Food” initiatives,  such funding supplier projects linked to  the food transition (e.g., transitioning to  organic farming and switching to more  animal-friendly farming methods). Through the issuance of Sustainability- Linked Bonds (“ SLBs ”), Carrefour is  committed to further reinforce the  alignment of its funding strategy with its  sustainability goals."
Carrefour_115,"To this end, Carrefour has decided  to include the option to issue SLBs  (as further described in Section 3.2  (SLB Framework) below) into its Euro  Medium Term Notes programme in  2021, which includes Sustainability  Performance Targets that are aligned  with the sustainability goals identified by  Carrefour. In that respect, regardless of whether  or not the applicable Sustainability  Performance Target(s) has/have been  reached (as defined below), Carrefour  may elect to dedicate part of the  proceeds of any SLB issuance to fund  CSR Projects. For the purpose of SLB issuance, "" CSR  Projects "" means the ""Act for Food""  project (as described in the 2020 URD) or any other internal project conducted  by the Issuer as part of its CSR (corporate  social responsibility) strategy. For the avoidance of doubt, SLBs  are not ""sustainable bonds"" or ""green  bonds"" where the proceeds would  be exclusively applied to finance or  refinance green or social projects or a  combination of both green and social  projects. Carrefour does not intend to  comply with the Green or Social Bond  Principles as published by ICMA."
Carrefour_120,"3.2. SLB FRAMEWORK  This Sustainability-Linked Bonds  Framework (the "" SLB Framework "") is  aligned with the five core components  of the Sustainability-Linked Bond  Principles published by the International  Capital Market Association ("" ICMA "") in  June 2020 as may be amended from  time to time (the "" ICMA SLBP "") (3). The ICMA SLBP are voluntary process  guidelines that outline best practices  for financial instruments to incorporate  forward-looking sustainability  outcomes and promote integrity in  the development of the SLB market by  (3) See: https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/sustainability-linked-bond-principles-slbp/20  I  CARREFOUR GROUP SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED BOND FRAMEWORK I  21 PART 3 SUSTAINABILITY FINANCING AND SLB FRAMEWORK clarifying the approach for the issuance  of a SLB.

Carrefour_125,"Bond Characteristics  3. Reporting  4. Verification  Sustainability-Linked Bonds ("" SLBs "")  are any type of bond instrument for  which the financial and/or structural  characteristics can vary depending on  whether the issuer achieves predefined  Sustainability/Environmental, Social  and Corporate Governance (“ ESG”)  objectives. In that sense, issuers of  SLBs are further committing explicitly  to future improvements in sustainability  outcome(s) within a predefined timeline  that are relevant, core and material  to their overall business. SLBs are a  forward-looking performance based  instrument."
Carrefour_130,"In this context, Carrefour intends to  issue SLBs which would comply with  the ICMA SLBP and thereby intends to  define ESG objectives that are material  to the Group's core sustainability and  business strategy (as described in  Section 2 above). The relevant KPI(s)  and SPT(s) will be selected by Carrefour  prior to each issuance of SLB under  Carrefour 's EMTN programme and will  be specified in the final terms of the  relevant SLB issue. The net proceeds of the issues of SLBs  will be used for the Group's general  corporate purposes. Carrefour does not  commit to allocate the net proceeds specifically to projects or business  activities meeting sustainability criteria,  the use of proceeds is not a determinant  in the SLB categorization.

We are all learning to live with the new reality created by these challenges that continue to cause broader concerns about peace and prosperity for all. This rapidly changing context urges the global business  community to respond with smarter innovation and more responsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act with a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to comply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical standards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to our vision to provide smarter technology for all and helping to decarbonize the global economy – one of humanity’s greatest challenges."

After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions reduction target, we have set a vision of achieving net-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science Based Targets initiative to determine the goals that support this vision. From an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid  cooling technology, combined with our High-Performance Computing cluster, helps data center customers become more energy efficient. For example, they enable our customer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power consumption by a third while increasing the amount of computing power per square foot of its existing data center by more than a hundredfold, which creates a real-time rendering process for creative artists. Lenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation  and supporting a circular economy by increasing the use of recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, increasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the size of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and reusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon emissions."
Lenovo_15,"Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in packaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight material. We have continued to increase our use of this material, and are now using it in the packaging for more than one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we expanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the ThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the transportation weight by 30 percent. We have continued to expand Lenovo’s renewable energy  installation as we work to achieve our energy-related targets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity in our worldwide locations has now reached approximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan."

Product Carbon Footprint There are numerous and substantial challenges to calculating an accurate carbon footprint forinformation and communications technology (ICT) products, especially if the intent is to use thedata for product-to-product comparisons."
Lenovo_385,"These challenges include: •  Collecting and compiling dependable emissions  data across a long and complicated supply chain •  Accurately allocating emissions from facilities across different geographies providing numerous products and services to multiple customers •  Maintaining current data with a continuously evolving and rapidly changing ICT product portfolio •  Ensuring consistency of results in an environment   where multiple and varying calculation methodologies are available The Company continues to search for an efficient and credible way to calculate its product footprints, and it also wants to understand the impacts while credibly disclosing environmental information about its products. With these challenges and goals, the Company joined the Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) Project , an ICT sector-wide  pre-competitive collaboration led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to streamline footprints for ICT products. To help address these challenges, MIT developed PAIA, an easy-to-use online platform that allows companies to significantly reduce the time and cost of environmental impact calculations.33 Lenovo Group Limited  2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance ReportExecutive Letters   About this Report   Environmental   Social   Governance   Global Supply Chain   Consolidated Metrics   EMS Performance, Objectives and Targets   Long Term KPI Progress   Appendix With a suite of simplified online tools, PAIA delivered  a methodology for ICT product footprints which originated from a multi-stakeholder initiative of ICT companies that shared insights and best practices. The Company’s participation in PAIA is helping to drive a sector-wide streamlined methodology that will be key to transforming ICT companies into sustainable businesses. The PAIA PCF calculation tools help to efficiently  calculate product carbon footprint (PCF) for a wide range of products and configurations."
Lenovo_390,"The Company’s product development groups currently use the PAIA tools for notebooks, desktops, workstations, monitors, all-in-ones, tablets, thin clients, servers, network switches, and storage products and are engaged in optimization of the online platform. Using PAIA tools to calculate product footprints has significantly reduced the time and cost of calculating environmental footprints for its products. The quality and accuracy of the calculations allow the Company to confidently communicate this information with customers and other stakeholders. The Company shares these results with enterprise customers and publishes them publicly as PCF information sheets.

Yang Yuanqing Chairman and Chief Executive Officer CO2 Offset Services The Company devised an CO2 Offset Service that  enables its customers to offset the carbon emissions associated with its devices at the point of purchase and help the environment by supporting one of several United Nations Climate Action projects. The Company first launched the program as a pilot in  the Nordics in February 2020."
Lenovo_925,"Building on this successful pilot, the Company rolled out the program in 2021 for all of Europe, Middle East, and Africa as well as Asia Pacific and North America. The innovative service enables customers to understand the ecological impact of every individual product and its lifetime usage simple and transparent. Customers are then able to contribute to specific ecological projects from across the globe and offset an equivalent total of emissions. The CO 2 Offset Service was developed as a solution  for its customers to help them meet their own  environmental goals. The service works by factoring in emissions produced from the manufacture and shipping of each individual product, as well as those for up to an estimated typical five years of usage."
Lenovo_930,"This amount is then offset through one of many partner initiatives, including projects overseen by the United Nations and ClimeCo. For more information about the Company’s CO 2  Offset Service, please visit https://techtoday.lenovo. com/us/en/co2-offset-services.78 Lenovo Group Limited  2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance ReportInnovative Solutions for a Circular Economy The Company’s vision to deliver Smarter Technology  for All extends to its practices that include Smarter Circular Design, Smarter Circular Use, and Smarter Circular Return activities. In a circular economy, products are made, used, then returned, instead of being discarded and consigned to waste. In this model, the greatest amount of value is extracted from a resource while in use."
Lenovo_935,"Then, at the end of its service life, the resource is recovered, refurbished, and redeployed. This drives greater resource productivity, makes businesses more competitive, and creates new opportunities for growth. The demand for a more circular economy has given rise to the ‘as a service’ or usage models seen across many industries in which the user pays for only what they need, when they need it, and returns the assets or resources when they are finished. The Company provides innovative solutions for its  customers’ business needs that help reduce the volume of end-of-life electronic products that may otherwise be discarded or consigned to waste. These solutions include: •  Services that keep products operating longer •  Services that make infrastructure management  easier •  Solutions to manage its customers’ products at the end of life to maximize value and reuse opportunities The Company’s introduction of  Device as a Service  (DaaS) to the PC industry has enabled organizations to maximize value throughout a product’s lifecycle and minimize raw material use and waste generation."
Lenovo_940,"DaaS is a usage model in which the consumer pays to use the device of their choice as they need it and has the option of pausing or returning the device when it is not in use. Along with the device, the Company offers a variety of services to protect and support the asset during its lifecycle. When the device reaches the end of its service life, the Company will collect the device, wipe it clean of the customer’s data, and recycle or repurpose it. This means the device can either be refurbished and reintroduced into a new working environment, or the device’s parts can be used to repair other devices under warranty. Customers only pay for what they use, avoiding the heavy capital outlays of the ownership model, as well as escaping the burden and cost of disposal."
Lenovo_945,"These services are addressing the industry’s transformation to as-a-service and providing lifecycle value to the Company’s customers. With a vision for a net zero carbon future, the  Company knows the transition to a circular economy is critical. To help scale circular economy solutions in the IT industry, the Company has established a target to enable the recycling and reuse of 800 million pounds of end-of-life products by 2025/26 1. For more  information see Section 9.0. 1 Cumulative total since 2005."

The Company’s supply base is comprised of the following categories: internal manufacturing centers, production procurement, original design manufacturers (ODM), and general procurement."
Lenovo_960,"Production procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials or components that become part of the Company’s products. ODMs include manufacturing partners who manufacture products on behalf of the Company. General procurement includes all suppliers that  provide materials and products which support the Company’s operations but do not become part of its products. The Company’s supply base is comprised of multiple tiers in which lower tiers of suppliers provide materials and parts to higher tiers – and eventually to its Tier 1 suppliers, the suppliers with whom the Company has a direct contractual relationship. The disclosures in this report apply to the Company’s  production procurement supplier base."
Lenovo_965,"The majority of the Company’s spend is with production procurement suppliers which often have ESG impact and risk. Production procurement suppliers can have social risks because they require substantial labor forces and have access to large, lower-skilled labor pools that are vulnerable to exploitation. Production procurement suppliers may generally also have environmental impacts through the energy, water, and materials required for production. Distribution of Suppliers The Company recognizes there are many benefits in utilizing local suppliers, including decreased logistics costs, potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity to support local economies and maintain community relationships. The Company considers local suppliers as those that operate in the same country as its significant locations of operations."
Lenovo_970,"In FY 2021/22, its significant locations of operations included manufacturing locations in China, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Hungary, Japan, and India. The Company estimates that 90 percent of production supply spend in China is with local suppliers. In other manufacturing geographies, the Company estimates that 20 percent of spend is with local suppliers.

Given this, the Company has many controls and programs in place to manage its overall procurement process."
Lenovo_975,"The Company recognizes that ESG risks and impacts exist among its suppliers which may differ from the ESG impacts and risks associated with the Company’s own operations. To better manage these risks, the Company has integrated several ESG-specific controls and practices into its Master Procurement Process. Key elements of the procurement process include: Master Procurement Process The Company’s Master Procurement Process is  designed to oversee all purchase commitments for production materials and the goods and services that support its worldwide operations. With a mission to deliver the best pricing, quality, supply, technology, and service in a sustainable manner, this model provides a controlled procurement approach that is applied across the organization for commodities and includes the following elements for production and general procurement: Delegation Authority The Company’s Code of Conduct includes requirements for the formal delegation which support accountability and responsible procurement practices. The ‘Authority to Make Lenovo Commitments’ section outlines the requirements for delegations with well-defined authority for commitments and other contract terms and conditions and, most importantly, that making business commitments outside these processes is not permitted."
Lenovo_980,"Supplier Selection Implementing a controlled approach to awarding the Company’s business to suppliers is critical to meet its procurement objectives and to establish a trusted base of suppliers. Therefore, even the perception of favoritism or bias is unacceptable. To ensure business awards are conducted ethically and fairly, the Company utilizes defined and approved sourcing methods to ensure the following: •  Suppliers have a fair opportunity to compete for  the Company’s business •  Buyers conduct an ethical evaluation on carefully understood facts such as supplier prices, terms, and conditions•  The most capable suppliers are selected based on the best overall acquisition value •  Business awards are reviewed and approved with   proper delegation of authority New Supplier Validation New suppliers are assessed for numerous capabilities including their operational aspects, financial stability, product security, and ESG expectations. More specifically, all new suppliers are reviewed on the Company’s sustainability policies, codes of conduct, ISO certifications, ESG standards, environmental impact aspects, controls to prevent forced labor, and public reporting. Of particular concern are suppliers that may be listed as restricted or denied parties identified by governments and/or international agencies."
Lenovo_985,"The Company’s policy and formal practice is that under no circumstances shall the Company’s personnel purchase, sell, or ship any product contrary to applicable export laws or to any individual or firm appearing in any relevant government list of any party who has been denied export or import privileges. During FY 2021/22, 78 companies were assessed using this process. Contract Management Supplier relationships are best managed when there are clear stipulations of responsibilities, deliverables, and relevant terms and conditions. The Company’s supplier contracts incorporate legal and operational agreements and address various types of engagement. Additionally, all production suppliers must comply with the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct and they are encouraged to comply with the latest version of Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Code of Conduct."
Lenovo_990,"Compliance with the comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct is executed via standard purchase agreements or standard purchase orders. The Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct, strictly prohibit bribery and corruption. The RBA audit protocol includes anti-bribery and anti-corruption in the Ethics section. Internal Training The Company recognizes that supply chain management is an ever-changing field. To ensure those with delegated authority are informed on current best practices, it conducts numerous communication and education activities throughout the year for its global supply chain team."
Lenovo_995,"Typically, the Company conducts monthly events that feature education opportunities with subject matter experts and provides on-demand targeted training. Beginning in FY 2021/22, the Company has enhanced the education program by releasing additional online training courses, targeting a 100 percent completion rate.84 Lenovo Group Limited  2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance Report(direct and through agencies), employee age  requirements, timesheets, pay slips, environmental controls, and other documents. The auditors also conduct individual and group interviews with a random selection of employees (direct and through external agencies). During those interviews the auditors, address freedom of association and collective bargaining among other topics by having conversations with the employees regarding their rights at the facility. The table below provides an overview of the  Company’s suppliers’ annual RBA audit performance."
Lenovo_1000,"Because suppliers are encouraged to be audited every two years, each year represents approximately one-half of the suppliers in its audit program for the given year (a total of 56 in the previous FY 2020/21). In the event of supplier non-conformance to ESG  requirements, including those identified by RBA audits, several actions may take place, which include: •  Immediate discontinuation of business for serious   violations •  Track audit findings to closure and required  supporting evidence whenever possible •  Penalize the supplier in the quarterly supplier report card score with a sustainability multiplier •  Senior procurement management engagement with the supplier •  Executive Company management engagement with the supplier In FY 2021/22, 71 RBA VAP audit reports were completed by the Company’s suppliers. According to the audit report results, none of the Company’s suppliers had findings related to the use of child labor or forced labor.Procurement Process The Company is committed to sound ESG management across its end-to-end supply chain process. It has ESG-specific systems in place, supported by contractual requirements to help ensure that suppliers meet or exceed applicable labor, environmental, health and safety, and ethics standards. The practices below align with its ESG-related internal  corporate policies."
Lenovo_1005,"The Company’s human rights commitments are codified through its Human Rights Policy and further explained in its Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. The Company’s environmental commitments are codified in its Environmental Affairs Policy, Climate and Energy  Policy and Water Resiliency Policy. The portions of these commitments that apply to its supply chain extend to suppliers through its Supplier Code of Conduct. RBA Leadership and VAP Audits The Company started an effort to require its suppliers to commit to achieving RBA ValidatedAudit Program (VAP) and Factory of Choice (FOC) designations to demonstrate leadership in ESG. This requires significantly high audit scores, formally trained site personnel, and proof of working grievance systems."
Lenovo_1010,"In FY 2021/22, 87 percent of the Company’s suppliers by spend achieved VAP Recognition, and almost 6 percent of the spend was designated Factory of Choice (FOC). By comparison, the numbers were 63 percent and 2 percent respectively in FY 2020/21. It is the Company’s goal that by 2024, 95 percent of its suppliers by spend will have RBA VAP recognition and 50 percent will have FOC recognition. Regardless of their self-assessment risk level, the  Company requires 95 percent of suppliers by spend to conduct an RBA VAP audit or an equivalent independent, third-party audit by RBA-approved auditors every two years. During these audits, independent auditors stay for several days at the supplier’s premises to review employee contracts 85 Lenovo Group Limited  2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance ReportExecutive Letters   About this Report   Environmental   Social   Governance   Global Supply Chain   Consolidated Metrics   EMS Performance, Objectives and Targets   Long Term KPI Progress   Appendix Historical Average Scores Labor ScoreHealth & Safety ScoreEnvironmental  Score Ethics ScoreManagement Score Total Score# of Priority findings# of Major findings Suppliers 2017 153 158 181 191 183 143 0.6 6.3 2018 156 167 184 191 188 149 0.7 5.0 2019 157 174 184 197 187 153 0.4 5.0 2020 157 173 189 199 190 155 0.3 5.4 2021 158 180 193 198 196 165 0.1 4.7 ODM Partners2019 156 175 182 197 188 156 0.2 5.6 2020 166 188 196 200 197 172 0.2 3.3 2021 167 181 197 194 194 170 0.1 3.9   Audit Results and Responses In FY 2021/22, 63 suppliers had major labor findings  identified in their audits."
Lenovo_1015,"The most common supplier audit findings are related to an industry-wide problem of excessive working hours and insufficient time off for their employees. While most of this work is done voluntarily by the employees, the Company considers these findings as significant or potentially negative social impacts. The Company requires its outsourced manufacturers to report their employees’ working hours and time off performance monthly via an online tool so that it can take action to resolve any issues that are identified. Because agreements for improvement were reached with suppliers with significant or potentially negative social impacts, no relationships were terminated as a result of the labor findings.

Lenovo_1025,"Living Wages Through the RBA audit and corrective action process, the Company drives suppliers to adhere to applicable wage and benefit laws and regulations. In FY 2021/22, the Company decided to move a step forward to extend the responsibility from the worker’s individual wellbeing to an employee’s family. The Company is participating in the RBA Living Wage work group and is exploring the development of implementation guidelines to support workers throughout the supply chain. The ultimate target of the Living Wage project team is to publish a Living Wage policy, to deliver training, and verify the baseline within its business in 2022.Joint Audits with Company’s PCSD Quality  Team Besides running the Company’s formal RBA Program,  the Global Supply Chain Team also collaborates with the Company’s PCs and Smart Devices (PCSD) Quality Team to conduct on-site audits in suppliers’ facilities. With assistance from the Quality Team, the Company is building a new way to emphasize the importance of monitoring its suppliers."
Lenovo_1030,"The new joint program was launched in October 2021. In total, 81 PCSD Quality Engineers have been trained by the Company’s RBA professionals and have engaged in 80 supplier audits. These audits focus on Labor, Health and Safety.

Since 2012, the Company has adhered to the following efforts and expects its production procurement and ODM suppliers to do the same: •  The intentions of the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) ‘Dodd-Frank 1502 Rule’ even if not directly regulated by the U.S. SEC •  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Sourcing Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas •  RBA Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) program The Company supports the efforts of the RMI to address materials beyond 3TG. In FY 2021/22, the Company conducted extensive due diligence for the Company’s cobalt supply chain using the  Cobalt  Reporting Template (CRT) and the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)."
Lenovo_1040,"The Company will coordinate with the RMI as RMI performs risk profiles on other materials, assess the content in its products, and further develop due diligence efforts to mitigate supply chain risk. These efforts were initiated through RMI’s coordination with the ‘Drive Sustainability’ organization which has already developed risk profiles on over 30 materials in the technology and automotive industry. For more information, please visit the Lenovo Responsible Sourcing webpage.EcoVadis The Company is continuously increasing focus on sustainability in procurement. In FY 2021/22, it began to strategically expand the scope of ESG assessments to suppliers across all categories by launching the EcoVadis tools. The EcoVadis platform aims to provide ESG ratings  for a large base of suppliers, including production procurement, general procurement, and other key suppliers."
Lenovo_1045,"The Company has implemented the EcoVadis IQ tool to screen suppliers’ ESG risk, based on their inherent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) risks and procurement information. In FY 2021/22, more than 457 suppliers were processed in the EcoVadis IQ tool, and 110 suppliers were invited to conduct an EcoVadis ESG assessment. The Company continues to ensure that all strategically  important suppliers participate in the EcoVadis program and achieve at least 45 of 100 points or a comparable audit result. Suppliers scoring less than 45 out of 100 points must implement a corrective action plan (CAP) and the progress will be tracked within 90 days.

The convergence of business function leaders provides the opportunity to evaluate the impacts on the other functions and develop a consolidated business continuity plan with clear actions. Effective risk management strategies have been a  critical part of driving business performance. The Company has also recognized opportunities are created when it transforms risks into opportunities that can support its long-term growth."
Lenovo_1095,"The Risk Council recently directed a scenario planning exercise that included identifying potential risks from the following categories: •   Strategy •   Financial •  Catastrophic events •  Human Capital •  Legal and Regulatory Compliance •   Operations •   Sociopolitical After analyzing these categories, the strategy team  selected the top five risks for the fiscal year. With consideration of the organization’s risk appetite and the business-driven data that was collected, the team selected the top five potential risks and conducted a comprehensive scenario planning for each risk. For each scenario, the team incorporated stakeholder feedback, identified contributing factors, and analyzed both short-term and long-term impacts. The information derived from this planning exercise  enabled the GSC Risk Council to understand the types of risks that may impact the Company and how those conditions may affect its performance, thus contributing to the development of greater strategy resilience and flexibility throughout the supply chain.In FY 2021/22, the Company’s total U.S. spend across all business units with small and/or diverse suppliers accounted for 23 percent of its total expenditure in the U.S. In FY 2021/22, the Company also exceeded the U.S.  Government Small Business Subcontract Plan target of 12 percent by achieving 16 percent of U.S. spend with small businesses over the course of the Fiscal Year."
Lenovo_1100,"The Company continues to partner with several  non-government organizations (NGO) such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women’s Business Enterprise Networking Council (WBENC). The Company also increased support to minority businesses through the “Evolve Small” program, in collaboration with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Toronto Regional Board of Trade. Through this initiative, the Company helped small businesses recover from the impact of COVID-19 by providing sixty companies in seven different markets across the United States and Canada ongoing support throughout the year. As the Company moves forward, its success not only  lies within workforce diversity but also in the inclusion of diverse suppliers that provide competitive advantages, increased innovation, and revenue that can support its brand reputation. Building Supply Chain Resilience In 2021, the Company established the GSC Risk Council to support risk management throughout its supply chain."
Lenovo_1105,"The GSC Risk Council’s mission is to boost the Company’s growth by implementing risk controls through industry-proven processes that can enable the supply chain to quickly adapt to demands for new technology and reduce the risk associated with the transition. Agility and resilience are critical components for a successful GSC strategy than can withstand the short lifecycle of information and communications technology products and changing consumer demands. The GSC Risk Council’s main objectives include the  oversight of: •  Risk identification •  Risk assessment •  Risk control •  Risk review and follow-up •  Scenario planning92 Lenovo Group Limited

headcount of approximately 75,000 worldwide. 2  Employment type and geographical data is aligned with the FY 2021/22 Financial Annual Report. 3  Employee representation data includes regular employees only."
Lenovo_1110,"Data excludes:  –  Consultants and vendors working through a contract agency or third-party performing services or consulting on site for a brief  time and hence excluded from our scope. –  Contractors who usually perform non-critical, non-core jobs and their employment decisions, including pay and benefits, are made by the third-party employer – and hence excluded from our scope. –  Supplemental students who are interns or who are hired for a very short window of time and hence excluded from our scope. 4  Turnover rate data covers voluntary departure of regular employees for the full FY 2021/22. Involuntary turnover is planned exi t of  employees which is in alignment with the company strategy and decisions."
Lenovo_1115,"Hence, as a strategic and standard practice, this is excluded from reporting. 5  In FY 2020/21, turnover rates by region were transposed among AP, China and EMEA. Totals did not change but were realigned with   the corresponding region. 6  Metrics based on FY beginning with FY 2018/19. Results were not revised."
Lenovo_1120,"7  Lenovo’s total contributions in responding to natural disasters is US$8,128,720.76. This amount is tracked at the geo level. In  prior  reporting periods, the Company reported a separate line item for global disaster response. Beginning with FY 2021/22, the disaster response total will be integrated into the respective geographic contributions. 8  Increase in China giving reflects tracking of Lenovo Foundation Beijing and a US$7.8M donation in response to the Henan floods."
Lenovo_1125,"9  Total giving in Latin America reflects tracking of the Motorola Brazil tax incentive program. 10  Total contribution in Asia Pacific includes Lenovo’s commitment to the India Companies Act. 11  Estimated value of employee volunteer hours is calculated based off an entry level hourly wage of US$43 per hour. 12  Employee giving represents the corporate match from Lenovo for employees around the world, which increased in FY 2021/22 with t he  launch of the new Benevity platform. 13  Total contribution to communities for FY 2019/20 and FY 2020/21 was defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations."
Lenovo_1130,"In  FY 2021/22 it is defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations together with Lenovo's match of global employee donations. 14  Product transportation emissions include key upstream suppliers representing majority of global logistics spend. Note: Upon loo king  into GHG Protocol standard, we decided to re-categorize this to upstream from downstream transportation (from FY 2016/17, previous years were adjusted accordingly). 15  The Company is in the process of improving input data for this Scope 3 category. The data reported here is the best available e stimate  at the time of publication."
Lenovo_1135,"In the FY 2022/23 ESG Report, data will be restated if needed to reflect any improved input data. 16  Emissions from waste include nonhazardous waste, hazardous waste and wastewater from all manufacturing, R&D locations and some large offices. No product waste is included. 17  Purchased goods and services include suppliers covering 94% of direct global suppliers spend. The RBA Carbon and Water Reportin g  Tool was used for collection of supplier data."
Lenovo_1140,Individual supplier data is from each supplier’s most recent reporting period and not reflective of Lenovo’s FY 2021/22. Data was allocated based on revenue. 18  The value for FY 2018/19 is being restated to correct an error that appeared in the FY 2020/21 ESG Report. 19  Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include transmission & distribution (T&D) losses from Lenovo ’s  worldwide purchased electricity and natural gas. A World Bank database and Energy Star Performance Rating document were used for determining T&D loss rates.
Lenovo_1145,"20  Lenovo used the current Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client a nd  server tool for calculating emissions of Lenovo’s typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server. The calculated results show emissions distribution by different parts and also for use, packaging, transportation, and end-of-life treatment categories. The emissions associated with use and end-of-life treatment of sold products were estimated on a “narrow” baseline for the typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server multiplied by sold/shipped product volumes. 21  Emissions from capital goods are based on purchased capital goods in a given year. The 2012 Guidelines to Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Annex 13 was used for emission factors for different type of capital goods adjusted for inflatio n rate  and exchange rate.109 Lenovo Group Limited  2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance ReportExecutive Letters   About this Report   Environmental   Social   Governance   Global Supply Chain   Consolidated Metrics   EMS Performance, Objectives and Targets   Long Term KPI Progress   Appendix 22 Approximately less than 1% of purchased energy (electricity) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities wi th  metered usage."
Lenovo_1150,"23  When totals are slightly different than the exact sum of individual numbers it is due to rounding. 24  Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, United States, Chinese mainland, Taiwan, China represent manufacturing and R&D  sites  in these markets. “Rest of World” represents all sites managed by Lenovo’s Real Estate organization (non-manufacturing) across the  world (small and large — except the ones in regions listed above). 25  Renewable energy generation capacity includes electric solar panels in Hefei and Wuhan, China and Morrisville and Whitsett, NC,  USA  and Ullo, Hungary. 26  For FY 2021/22, All Areas includes all the Company’s manufacturing, research & development, and large office sites (>100 employ ees)."
Lenovo_1155,"In earlier FYs, some research and development and large office locations were excluded while the Company worked to increase data coverage. Small offices (<100 employees) and retail locations are always excluded from the water reporting requirements, but a few small offices voluntarily report and are included. 27  All water withdrawals are estimated to be freshwater withdrawals. Due to our reliance on third-parties for the vast majority of  the  Company’s water withdrawals, it is not possible to determine the exact parameters of all sources, but it is reasonable to assume the majority of the sources had low TDS based on local knowledge and communication with third-parties. 28  Areas with water stress are areas with high or extremely high baseline water stress according to World Resources Institute’s Aq ueduct  Water Risk Atlas."
Lenovo_1160,"Values reported for areas with water stress are a subset of values reported for all areas. 29  Third-party withdrawal by source was collected for all the Company’s environmentally significant sites (which are the Company’s   ISO14001 certified locations). In FY 2021/22, these locations comprised approximately 82% of the Company’s withdrawal from water stressed areas. The remaining 18% are primarily from office locations that often require less water and operate as part of a larger office complex where they may not be directly billed by the third-party responsible for withdrawals. 30  For more information on the wastewater exceedance that occurred in FY 2021/22, see page 25."
Lenovo_1165,"31  Water intensity metrics are based on the Company’s total global headcount which includes the headcount of the excluded location s  mentioned in Note 26. 32  Waste data includes site waste from most manufacturing, processes and operations, research & development sites, and large offic es. Waste from products is reported separately. 33  E-waste generated at the Company’s sites is also included in PELM data. 34  Batteries collected at Lenovo’s sites are also included in the PELM data."
Lenovo_1170,"35  The Company does not operate any onsite recovery operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties f or  recovery offsite. 36  Recycling includes some composting of nonhazardous, organic wastes. 37  All hazardous waste diverted for recovery was diverted for recycling. 38  The Company does not operate any onsite disposal operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties f or  disposal offsite. 39 Lenovo’s Product End-of-Life Management (PELM) and Product Take Back (PTB) includes materials from customers and Lenovo-owned   country returns, manufacturing and R&D scrap, and employee equipment from real estate sites."
Lenovo_1175,"These metrics represent all data received from PELM suppliers as of the time of publication of this report. Not all data was available at the time of publication, so actual volumes may be higher. 40  These metrics represent all data received from recycled plastics suppliers at the time of publication. 41  The CY2021 decrease in percent of notebooks can be attributed to an expanded line of gaming system notebooks that either could  not  meet the Energy Star requirements or Lenovo decided not to register. 42  The CY2021 decrease in percent of monitors was associated with an expanded line of low cost, entry-level consumer displays."

General Electric_40,"COVER  Pictured: Aviation’s Sheena Walker, Evendale, Ohio; Healthcare’s Bryan Smith, Arkansas; Gas Power’s Reggie Brewster, Greenville, South Carolina Dear Fellow Stakeholders,  Throughout our 130-year history, GE has demonstrated a larger purpose of lifting up  the quality of life for people around the globe. Our approximately 168,0001 employees  work with customers, partners, communities, and governments in over 175 countries to deploy and innovate technology to solve the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges across energy, health, and flight. Every day, our people rise to the challenge of building a world that works, in service of a more connected, healthier, and more sustainable future. In year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that global recovery – both economic and societal –  remains uneven. Supply chain constraints continue to challenge businesses, government budget shortfalls hinder efforts to provide essential services, and millions of people around the world have faced significant disruption to their education and employment."
General Electric_45,"Throughout 2021, our GE teams continued to assist healthcare providers, partners, communities, and patients around the world to address the ongoing health crisis, and we worked with local organizations in some of the hardest-hit communities to respond to humanitarian challenges. The devastating war in Ukraine is no different, and the GE team stands proudly with the people of Ukraine. Our number one priority has been the safety of our people in the region, and we have acted diligently both to relocate those in harm’s way and support our Ukrainian employees working elsewhere in Europe. We have donated $4 million in medical equipment to those affected along with $500,000 for international aid groups to support refugees. I’m especially inspired by the GE employees who have opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees and volunteered their time to help with other refugee efforts."

GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  1   The shape of things to come  We are taking steps today to further strengthen GE’s ability to lead  on some of the defining trends of our time—driving decarbonization through the energy transition, enabling precision health, and creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight. In November 2021, we announced plans to form three independent, investment-grade companies that will be better positioned for long-term growth and improved service to customers, employees, and communities. We plan to spin off Healthcare first in early 2023, combine Renewable Energy, Power, and Digital into one business to launch as an independent public company a year later, thus creating our third company focused on Aviation."
General Electric_55,"As we look ahead to forming three industry leaders with sustainability at their core, these strong independent businesses will better leverage our innovation muscles, technology expertise, leadership, and global reach to build a world that works for everyone. ENERGY TRANSITION  As a company whose equipment helps generate one-third of the world’s electricity, we have a responsibility to lead the industry’s decarbonization efforts while solving the energy “trilemma” of affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity, particularly for the more than 750 million people without access. Our energy businesses provide powerful, integrated solutions with some of the most innovative onshore and offshore wind turbines, most efficient gas turbines, as well as advanced technology to modernize and digitize electrical grids. For example, our powerful Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype in Rotterdam began operating at 14 MW. One Haliade-X 14 MW turbine can generate up to 74 GWh of gross annual energy production, saving up to 52,000 metric tons of CO 2, which is the equivalent of the emissions  generated by 11,000 vehicles  in one year."
General Electric_60,"We have over 7 GW of  Haliade-X commitments worldwide. * We believe in the important role of building the breakthrough technologies the world will need in the future, including low- and zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen for new and existing gas plants, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS), offshore wind superconducting generators, and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). For example, we are working with customers to construct and update power plants in the U.S., Australia, and China to run on blends of hydrogen and natural gas, and to develop front-end engineering design studies for CCUS solutions in the U.S. and U.K., which can significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from power generation. GE’s Haliade-X, the only independently certified 12+ MW offshore wind turbine today. PRECISION HEALTH  Enabling precision health will require integrated, efficient, and highly personalized care while improving access, particularly to the half of the world’s population that is underserved."
General Electric_65,"In Healthcare, we are developing innovative new technology that will further personalize and streamline the entire healthcare experience, from diagnosis to treatment and through recovery. For example, Healthcare launched the Vscan Air handheld wireless color ultrasound scanner that increases access to innovative care—including rural areas where such technology may not otherwise exist. With 30,000 units impacting the care of more than 50 million patients worldwide, our Vscan Family technologies help doctors deliver better care to more people. To strengthen the healthcare system’s ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a statewide system in Oregon powered by artificial intelligence that gives clinicians near real-time information about intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, acute hospital beds, and emergency department wait times. As a result, we are reducing administrative burdens on hospital resources and helping improve both patient care and prevent staff burnout."
General Electric_70,"To date, 95% of the state’s beds are live in the system. * According to wind conditions on a typical German North Sea site. GE Healthcare’s Vscan is a pocket-sized ultrasound that offers crystal clear image quality and whole-body scanning capabilities. FUTURE OF FLIGHT  Innovations that improve fuel efficiency are defining the future of flight, and Aviation is helping the industry make meaningful progress toward its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. GE Aviation is unique in the industry for the scale and ambition it is bringing to confront this problem, as we pursue solutions across Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as well as hybrid electric and hydrogen-powered flight."
General Electric_75,"Today, all GE and partner engines are able to operate on approved SAF, which could lower lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to petroleum-based fuels. GE Aviation, together with GE Research, is advancing commercial hybrid electric propulsion systems through key partnerships with ARPA-E and NASA. Additionally, Airbus and CFM International  are collaborating  on tests of a modified GE Passport engine fueled by hydrogen. We are also innovating the next generation of aircraft engines. CFM launched the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program to demonstrate advanced technologies, with ground and flight tests expected in the middle of this decade."
General Electric_80,"This program could ultimately lead to engines that would use 20 percent less fuel and reduce CO 2 emissions by 20  percent more than the most efficient jet engines built today. * CFM RISE Program goals include reducing fuel consumption and CO 2  emissions by more than 20% compared to today’s most efficient engines. GE’S GLOBAL REACH  We have equipped  90%  of the world’s power transmission utilities with our technology Our equipment serves  1B+  patients per year Every  2 seconds  a GE or partner *  powered aircraft takes off  Driving progress on climate  In 2020, we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own  operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030. As described in this report, to achieve this goal, our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing, and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste. For example, our Gas Power team held a “Carbon and Energy Savings Kaizen Week” earlier this year across 21 sites focused on reducing energy consumption that identified an average savings of seven percent energy usage per site."
General Electric_85,"In 2021, we articulated GE’s ambition to be a net zero company by 2050, including not just GE’s own operations, but also the Scope 3 emissions associated with the use of our sold products. In this report, we provide more details about the path we see to achieving this ambition and connect the dots between our historic progress to reduce emissions, delivering state of the art technology this decade, and innovating the breakthrough technologies for tomorrow with our net zero ambition for energy and aviation. We know our employees, customers, suppliers, policymakers, and other stakeholders are counting on GE not only to reduce emissions, but to innovate the technology the world needs to achieve its goals. We are optimistic our efforts can drive both sustainability and business success. Our Board of Directors oversees the execution of GE’s sustainability priorities and initiatives as an integrated part of the Company’s overall strategy and risk management."
General Electric_90,"The Board discussed and helped shape the actions above and oversees the Company’s decarbonization strategy highlighted throughout this report. Fostering a diverse & inclusive workplace  The only way we are going to achieve our goals at GE is to ensure that we are able to recruit, retain, and promote the best talent. Teams that include diverse backgrounds and perspectives are absolutely critical to driving the lean mindset and innovative approach that we will need to shape the energy transition, precision health, and future of flight. This is why we are proud of the progress we have made in the last year to improve GE’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I), and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to launch three independent companies that will maintain our dedication. We continued to focus our DE&I efforts on transparency."
General Electric_95,"This means clearly reporting our employment diversity in new and more detailed ways so that all interested parties can easily understand where we are and hold us accountable as we progress toward where we want to be. This data has been informing the areas where we need to invest greater time and resources. Since 2020, we saw growth at the leadership level for both women globally (+1.2%) and for total U.S. race and ethnic minority (+1.7%). While men and women performing similar work are paid within one percent of each other across each GE business, we are committed to achieving 100 percent pay equity. Finally, we were thrilled this year to appoint Brandi Thomas as our new Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), who is reporting directly to me and building on Mike Barber’s work following his retirement."
General Electric_100,"Brandi’s leadership experience—inside and outside of GE—combined with her history of building diverse teams and deployment of lean make her the right CDO for GE. I look forward to partnering with her to accelerate our progress. Building a world that works  During a recent visit to our GE Renewable Energy facility in Pensacola, Florida, I had the chance to meet with employees, hear about their lean journey over the past few years, and witness how deeply we have embedded lean within our culture. Lean in its simplest terms is about focusing on the customer, eliminating waste and prioritizing relentlessly. Our lean mindset is giving us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary trade-offs."
General Electric_105,"In 2021, employees at the Pensacola facility held more than a dozen kaizen exercises seeking to find ways to make production more flexible and resilient. The work has been paying off. Just last year, lean helped the plant significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to build a turbine, decreasing the number of build hours by six percent and shortening the time spent on the production line by 12 percent. Importantly, in this example, lean is helping us deliver on our sustainability strategy while enabling customers to meet their decarbonization goals. As we prepare for a new and defining chapter in GE’s history, sustainability is deeply rooted in all of our plans and priorities."
General Electric_110,"I’m incredibly proud of the ownership and initiative that our employees have displayed in this area, as well as the shared appreciation they have for doing things the right way. With this collective mindset in place, I know we can continue to expand on our 2021 accomplishments in the years ahead to build a world that works—for everyone. H. LAWRENCE CULP, JR.

As these pages show, this sense of purpose unites our approximately 168,000 2 employees every day."
General Electric_115,"Parts II and III focus on the other side of our sustainability mission:  how we work to improve our impacts to our people, communities, and planet. These efforts—frequently referred to as Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)—are core both to our operations today and the businesses we plan to create. Our approach to ESG mirrors how we run GE more broadly. We approach ESG with the same spirit of humility, transparency, and rigor as our businesses, with a focus on where we need to improve performance, address gaps, and enhance programs. The two words that most come to mind are “continuous improvement.” This concept, core to lean management at the heart of GE’s transformation, drives us to focus our attention on what we need to do better to succeed in our goals."
General Electric_120,"In 2021, this spirit of continuous improvement drove three ESG priorities. First, we prioritized progress toward the commitments and ambitions we announced in recent years. Regarding climate change, our businesses detail their efforts to make operational improvements on our path to carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (pages 92-95). Our Aviation and Power businesses also share details regarding the Scope 3 emissions from their sold products. This includes, for the first time, a road map of innovation and technology toward the path to net zero for these critical and complex technologies in the years and decades to come ( pages 35  and 53)."
General Electric_125,"Second, we took a transparent look at where we could do better and took action to close program gaps. This includes a broad internal and external stakeholder survey for GE Company and our businesses ( pages 61-63 ). With this feedback, we pursued efforts to articulate  our policies more clearly on product safety and quality (pages 66-70), to develop a holistic strategy around product stewardship ( pages  104-106 ), and to provide more details in this Report surrounding our  governance and compliance programs (pages 73-74). Third, following November’s announcement that we plan to create three independent companies, we worked across GE to ensure that these impactful companies would operate with sustainability at their core on day one. We are fully seizing the opportunity in this ESG era to create new companies focused on critical global needs in energy, healthcare, and aviation, merging the legacy of GE’s technology and culture and the best-in-class expertise of modern sustainability programs."
General Electric_130,"Along the way, we sought success not just as GE, but in partnership with our stakeholders. Our policy and lobbying report details our increasingly visible public engagement on furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement ( page 98 ). With the growing focus on sustainable  finance, we engaged most of our global banks to strengthen  partnerships on deploying both technology and funding toward net zero goals. And we listened to stakeholders who reached out to us—our customers, investors, NGOs, regulators, and others—on their input for success in our mission, reflected in these pages. Of these stakeholders, our employees are top of mind."
General Electric_135,"A Sustainability Business Council, comprised of each GE business and Corporate function, operationalizes our ESG programs. GE’s Green Team Network, our employee resource group focused on supporting and furthering GE’s sustainability goals, is a constant inspiration for engagement that brings positive impact both globally and locally to over 175 countries. On behalf of GE’s employees, we are proud to share our performance and efforts. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, I invite you  to reach out to me with your input as we pursue success for these ESG priorities.

General Electric_650,"BUILDING ON SUBSTANTIAL  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PAST ACTION  GE’s power technology has made substantial contributions to global  decarbonization efforts for many years. For example, over the past decade, while global coal generation across the industry grew by 6% (2010  2021), estimated generation from GE’s installed base of coal plants declined by 44% (2010  2021), fueled by retirements and coal-to-gas switching. Estimated generation from GE’s gas installed base grew by 17% during this period. With less than half of the carbon emissions of a comparably sized coal plant and the operating flexibility to accommodate variable renewable generation, gas played a vital role contributing to the reduction in carbon emissions without sacrificing grid resilience. During this same period, there was a 16% increase in estimated generation from GE’s installed low-carbon power generation technologies (wind, hydro, nuclear)."
General Electric_655,"The net of these changes resulted in an estimated reduction in carbon intensity of the total GE installed base by 22% over this time period. Over the past decade and a half, coal-to-gas switching has done more to decarbonize the U.S. power sector than any other technology. At the same time, GE has accumulated more than 1.3 million operating hours on its World Record Efficiency H-class gas turbines (with nearly one-third the carbon emissions of a coal plant). Advanced gas path upgrades deployed to GE’s existing F-class fleet over the past three years reduced roughly 2 million tons of CO 2 emissions. Gas plants play a vital role balancing variable renewables with dispatchable flexible power, preserving system resilience."

General Electric_705,"PETER J. ARDUINI  President & CEO, GE Healthcare  We know that we can do more. We want to enable earlier, better and  faster diagnosis and treatment for more people in need, while reducing or eliminating our impact on the environment. Key to achieving that aim will be improving access to healthcare globally, especially to the half of the world’s population that is underserved and cannot access essential health services. Of all  new cancer cases in the world, a majority occur in low-income countries and, in addition to population factors, this is partly exacerbated by lack of preventative strategies and a shortage of medical equipment. In places like Nigeria where breast and cervical  cancer are on the rise, we’ve helped equip the Marcelle Ruth  hospital with advanced technology, including mammography for screening and diagnostics and CT for radiation therapy, enabling patients, often for the first time, to get their care close to home."
General Electric_710,"To support a more sustainable future, we look for ways to help health systems improve efficiency and reduce waste. As they battle staffing shortages and an increasing number of patients, they can either build more hospital beds or find ways to better use existing resources to deliver care to more patients. Our AI-powered Command Center technology, used in more than 300 hospitals globally, offers real-time insights into patient workflow, helping staff to streamline discharge planning, surgical scheduling, care coordination and more. Through their Command Center, Tampa General Hospital in Florida was able to reduce patient length of stay by half a day and avoid the need for 64 new hospital beds—this has the equivalent carbon impact of taking about 3,900 cars off the road and saved the hospital $40 million in just over a year after implementation. For years, we have focused our efforts on developing medical equipment with best-in-class image quality and advanced software to increase diagnostic confidence."
General Electric_715,"But we are challenging ourselves to be better. We are developing efficiency features and leveraging digital to turn even the largest pieces of medical equipment into devices that make a smaller mark on our planet. Our new MR system, SIGNA TM Hero, is designed to be capable of lowering the use of helium, a scarce and non-renewable resource, by up to 67%. The current version of the magnet is 2 tons lighter than its predecessor. We have also enabled medical staff to easily decrease the power consumption of the MR and reduce scan time by up to 50%, saving both resources and improving the patient experience."
General Electric_720,"We are focused on developing innovative technology using sustainable design principles that extend the lifecycle of our products, often leveraging the strength of our field-based services teams to execute on this goal. In 2021, our team in Latin America performed more than 200 upgrades in hospitals and clinics, extending and enhancing the life of CT, MR, ultrasound and other life-saving equipment. This enables medical staff to, for example, obtain higher quality images or speed up exam times to see more patients, without the need for new equipment or expanding their facilities. No organization can tackle the breadth of healthcare challenges alone. We are bringing together an ecosystem of partners, leveraging the strengths of clinicians, technology leaders, academics and others to advance healthcare together."
General Electric_725,"In oncology, we are collaborating with several private companies and academic institutions. In the U.K., for example, we are working with The University of Cambridge to develop an AI-enhanced digital application that integrates cancer patient data from multiple sources into a single interface. We hope this will ultimately lead to cancer patients receiving faster and more personalized treatment. As we plan for a new chapter in our history to become an independent company, we are integrating sustainability more deeply into the core of our culture and business by working to expand access to healthcare; mitigating our climate impact; advancing the circular economy; designing with sustainability in mind; promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; and protecting patient data and cybersecurity.

General Electric_735,"We know the important role technology plays in our lives. From across the globe, we see how smart devices can help bridge shortage gaps as caregivers are increasingly having to do more with less. The U.S. is seeing major labor challenges, with a turnover of core staff between 15 to 20%. Smart solutions, such as our Command Center technology with operational AI, can help staff make quicker decisions based on predictive data, helping them improve productivity and allowing staff to focus on what really matters—their patients. Our technology also enables caregivers to bring advanced diagnostics and treatments to remote parts of the world where access to hospitals and medical equipment is limited."
General Electric_740,"The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that two-thirds of the world’s population has no access to basic X-ray or ultrasound examinations, and if they are available, quality and safety can be questionable or dangerous. Portable  solutions, such as handheld ultrasound, enable caregivers to bring the equipment to where the patient is. For example, staff at a small clinic in Zambia were able to see more than double the number of women as a result of using handheld ultrasound—helping to transform care for expectant women in their country. And if the patient is unable to come to the clinic, staff can easily bring the ultrasound to the patient’s home. But the value of portable technology such as handheld ultrasound is not limited to developing countries."
General Electric_745,"No matter the location or care circumstance, handheld ultrasound has proven an invaluable tool for many clinicians as a cost-effective, real-time tool to triage and determine patient care. The device’s portability, ease of use and connectivity make it an indispensable and critical tool for primary care providers and other healthcare professionals around the globe. In Southern France, in the remote commune of Les Vans—with a population of 2,600 and approximately 10,000 in the surrounding area—general practitioner Dr. Francis Pellet is able to manage complex cases with the use of handheld ultrasound. And with cloud connection, he can even collaborate virtually with his colleagues in Paris. This proved especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic."
General Electric_750,"During the pandemic, from a local pool of 2,000 people with pulmonary inflammatory symptoms, Dr. Pellet’s team tested everyone with ultrasound and identified 10 to 12 patients per day, or about 10%, who needed special follow-up or different monitoring. The handheld ultrasound also provided information that allowed him to diagnose a severe case of cardiac decompensation that required surgery 15 days later, and a surprising, serious case of advanced cardiomyopathy in a 20-year-old male. VSCAN AIR — EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE  Handheld ultrasound has become an essential tool, allowing clinicians to quickly collect images and triage patients while also providing the benefits of portability. The tool was designed to be accessible and usable without the need for adaptation or specialized design, across a wide variety of clinical specialties, clinician types, education levels, geographies and clinical settings. With 30,000 units impacting the care of more than 50 million patients worldwide, our Vscan Family technologies help doctors deliver expanded care to more people, including in rural regions."
General Electric_755,"Vscan is used globally across a variety of clinical settings. For example, in Germany, Vscan is being used by primary care physicians to improve speed to diagnosis.

General Electric_1065,"GE’s legacy has been to innovate technology  the world needs to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of civil aviation to lift up the quality of life for people everywhere. From the GE9X, which is the culmination of our decade-long  commercial product renewal, to the GE Passport and Catalyst  business and general aviation engines, to the T901 and T408  turboshafts for military helicopters, we have the industry’s broadest  array of  advanced engines offering better  fuel efficiency and  lower CO 2 emissions than their predecessors with advances in   engine architecture, aerodynamics and materials. Ceramic Matrix   Composites (CMCs) are lighter  weight than traditional metal alloys  and more heat resistant, allowing engines made with CMCs to operate at higher  temperatures with less cooling air. Additive Manufacturing   has led to lighter  weight engine parts with higher capabilities and more  complex designs than parts made by conventional manufacturing  methods. Including engine technology introduced by GE and CFM   International * in the last decade for commercial aircraft, engines   manufactured today consume 40% less fuel and emit 40% less CO2   compared to engines manufactured in the 1970s."

DRIVING CONTINUED PROGRESS   THIS DECADE  The aviation sector is uniquely united toward a net zero future. After   GE announced our ambition in 2021 to be a net zero company by 2050,  GE Aviation supported a similar 2050 goal set by Air  Transport Action  Group (ATAG) for net zero carbon emissions from flight. Also in 2021,  GE Aviation’s Chief Engineer joined other Chief  Technology Officers from  across the industry  to call for continued focus on sustainability in the  aviation sector and to continue advancing state-of-the-art in aircraft  and engine design to reduce carbon emissions. GE Aviation has joined  the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) to support  development of standards for reporting Scope 3 use of sold products  emissions across the aerospace industry."
General Electric_1075,"These standards will help GE  measure in a way  that is consistent with other aviation stakeholders  how  the carbon intensity of our engines is reduced over  time through  introduction of new  technologies and services that reduce emissions. In terms of  technology and innovation, implementation of  the next  level step breakthrough technology  will be paced by  the evolution  of new aircraft and engine designs, infrastructure, and regulations  given the sector’s unique considerations relating to safety, reliability, and the physics of aviation. Over  the next decade, GE expects to  continue collaboration with others in our industry  to drive operational  improvements and increased availability and use of Sustainable  Aviation Fuel (SAF) while investing in new engine technologies to drive  further reductions in the future. GE has never been more focused on innovating technology  to solve   one of  the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges: keeping   people connected while reducing climate impacts. To that end, GE   spent $1.6 billion10 on aviation research and development in 2021,   including emissions-reducing aviation technologies while continuing to   put safety first."
General Electric_1080,"GE Aviation is also investing in and supporting technologies that can be  quickly adopted to further reduce aviation carbon emissions from the  global fleet of engines in service. Technologies we see having impact this decade include:  SAF has been shown to provide reduction in overall CO2 lifecycle   emissions up to 80% compared to fossil fuels. And SAF made by new   approaches that convert renewable energy  to liquid fuel has the   potential to eliminate lifecycle CO2 emissions. Currently, SAF approved   for use is a blend of petroleum-based Jet A or  Jet A-1 fuel and a SAF   component with a maximum blend limit of  50%. One of GE’s fuel experts  chairs an international task force developing standardized industry  specifications supporting adoption of 100% drop-in 11 SAF, which does   not require blending with conventional jet fuel."
General Electric_1085,"Increased availability  and use of SAF is critical to reduce emissions in the existing fleet of  installed aircraft engines and future fleets. That’s why GE Aviation  is advocating for incentives that encourage greater development  across the supply chain to make SAF more available and affordable  compared to conventional jet fuel. For example, GE Aviation has joined  the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), an independent,  international organization helping develop market policies for SAF and  helping ensure SAF feedstock is resourced responsibly. GE’s proprietary  360 FOAM WASH is an advanced on-wing cleaning technology  to help ensure that engines continue to operate efficiently. In  the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions, GE’s 360 Foam Wash has been  found to significantly improve engine performance by reducing build-up  of deposits in the engine, lowering engine exhaust temperatures, and  improving engine compressor efficiency."
General Electric_1090,"These improvements lead to  reduced fuel consumption and lower CO 2 emissions. GE’s 360 Foam Wash   is approved for use on multiple GE engine programs, including models of   GE90, GEnx, CF34 and CF6, as well as Engine Alliance’s12 GP7200 engines. GE DIGITAL has developed a suite of software applications to help  aircraft operators reduce CO2 emissions and drive operational  efficiencies. For example, FlightPulse®  is a flight analytics tool that  helps airline pilots improve safety and operational decision-making, including recommendations for fuel savings. Fuel  Insight helps airlines  identify areas of opportunity  to improve their  fuel consumption,  while Airspace Insight offers flight path design and maintenance to assist aircraft operators in ensuring routes are optimally designed to minimize time, fuel, and emissions."

INNOVATING FOR  THE FUTURE  GE Aviation is investing now in the technology needed to reduce both  intensity and absolute emissions toward net zero by 2050. Knowing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, GE is investing in a diverse portfolio of  future technologies across the aviation sector, and intends  to advance technologies in the near, mid, and longer  term."
General Electric_1105,"This is some  of  the world’s most complex technology, and we are focused today on the innovation that’s going to be needed for the future. For  the technologies below, we are focused on three general phases for  their development. Today, we are working in our labs and research centers on the advancement of  the concepts and theories. In the middle of this decade, we aspire to start flight testing these technologies. We look to the middle of the 2030s as the likely time for  introducing these technologies commercially."
General Electric_1110,"OPEN FAN  The open fan design is one of  the advanced engine architectures  CFM is exploring through the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for  Sustainable Engines) Program. The parent companies came together  in June 2021 to launch the RISE Program, targeting more than 20% lower  fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions compared to today’s most  efficient engines. Central to the program is state-of-the-art propulsive efficiency  through the open fan design. Since GE Aviation first debuted  an unducted fan in the 1980s, the open fan engine design has been made simpler, lighter and quieter  with new approaches such as  single-stage rotating carbon fiber composite fan blades and stationary  composite outlet guide vanes. ELECTRIFICATION  GE has been advancing electrification of aircraft and engine systems for   more than a decade."
General Electric_1115,"During that time, GE engineers matured individual components of a hybrid electric system, including motors, generators and power converters. Now, we will take what has been learned in laboratories and combine these technologies into an integrated electric machine and associated power electronics for ground and flight tests planned for  the mid-2020s. Through a $260 million program with NASA,  GE Aviation will mature a megawatt class hybrid electric powertrain to demonstrate flight readiness for single-aisle aircraft using a modified Saab 340B testbed, GE’s CT7-9B turboprop engines and Dowty’s R390 propeller. GE Aviation has selected Boeing to support the program’s  flight tests and BAE Systems to design, test and supply energy  management components. HYDROGEN  CFM has also launched a demonstration program in collaboration with Airbus to ground and flight test a direct combustion engine fueled by  hydrogen."
General Electric_1120,"CFM will modify  the combustor, fuel system, and control  system of a GE Passport turbofan to run on hydrogen, a fuel which doesn’t generate carbon emissions during the combustion process. GE Aviation engineers are rising to this challenge with a global hydrogen team already in place and growing. Efforts to design and validate new combustor  technology compatible with hydrogen will  draw  from GE’s more than 8 million hours of operating experience with hydrogen combustion in land-based gas and steam turbines. Revolutionary  technologies and alternative fuels both have critical roles  to play in meeting the aviation industry’s long-term climate goal of  net  zero carbon emissions by 2050 for commercial flight. AVIATION INDUSTRY  VIEW OF ENERGY OPTIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO CO2 REDUCTION  Consistent with our collaboration principle above, GE knows that it will take partnership to succeed for net zero for  the aviation sector."

This position coordinates efforts by our business leaders, engineers and strategic thinkers to ensure we improve our impacts to our communities, people and planet in measurable and meaningful ways."
General Electric_1230,"The CSO also supports efforts for GE’s technology and innovation to address the pressing global challenges addressed in this report. In 2021, GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer convened a business-wide Sustainability Council staffed by each GE business and corporate function. The Sustainability Council meets weekly and focuses internally and externally on three overarching goals:  •  ensuring progress toward delivering on GE’s sustainability commitments;   •  improving and installing operational programs to address gaps in GE’s sustainability programs; and  •  building strong and independent ESG programs and operations for   each business prior  to their separation from GE so that sustainability  is core to the new businesses on day one  The Sustainability Council partners with a diverse range of external stakeholders to deliver on our commitments, improve our programs and prepare for  the separation. These efforts and progress are reflected in this report. Core to the Sustainability Council’s work was engaging in an ESG issues assessment with our internal and external stakeholders for  GE Company and each business, described below."
General Electric_1235,"This provides an overarching blueprint on how our priorities align with our stakeholders. Regarding delivering on our commitments, each business provided a quarterly update on progress toward greenhouse gas Scope 1 and 2 reduction goals (pages 92-95) and ongoing progress on innovating the technology  toward Scope 3 goals (pages 33-35 and 50-53). In terms of  gaps, we assessed that we could do a stronger job communicating our  programs that drive product safety and quality ( pages 66-69 ), as well as  strengthen sustainability considerations in the stewardship of product  design ( pages 104-106 ). We will continue to improve operations  and programs in these areas as described below  to position the businesses for leadership on these topics at core on day one of  their  independent operations. Beyond the Sustainability Council, sustainability at GE is the ultimate team effort, with GE’s employees united in realizing the success of  our mission."

GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  63   62  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  LEAN PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO SUSTAINABILITY  Our strategy for continuous improvement and eliminating waste  A GE Gas Power plant in Schenectady, NY, has become  a striking example of the power of lean management, a set of tools at the heart of GE’s transformation."
General Electric_1270,"Lean is the way we run our businesses. It helps drive better execution and cultural change, all while enabling sustainable, long-term profitable growth. It is known as a set of principles that emphasizes customer focus, elimination of waste, high-quality growth, continuous improvement and ruthless prioritization of work. Lean is enabling our businesses to play more offense, deliver for our customers and lead in three key areas—the energy transition, precision health and future of flight. Lean principles also drive the execution of our sustainability strategy  and help us addr ess problems, examine processes, implement  standard work and continuously improve the way we work."
General Electric_1275,"Dan Loughlin, the Team 6 Leader and CRW Operations Leader, giving Larry Culp  an overview of the team’s scope, progress to date and work ahead. Our Environment, Health and Safety teams work in close partnership with GE’ s lean leaders to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost  (SQDC), in that order. This includes using lean to improve worker safety, eliminate hazardous waste, implement leader standard work, limit emissions, reduce our carbon footprint and deliver essential, life-enhancing products quickly and efficiently. “Lean is not about manufacturing. It’s about everything  we do at GE and using the tools in a way that gives us the opportunity to drive real change and real improvement that serves everybody.”  - LARRY CULP  Chairman and CEO, GE CE O, GE Aviation The best way to see the power of lean in action is to go to the genba or “ where the work is done.” This allows one to experience firsthand the  process and to identify problems, then work to address those issues."
General Electric_1280,"This is what the GE senior leadership team did in October 2021. The  C ompany held a five-day immersive GE Kaizen Week at several GE  locations around the globe with more than 1,600 employees going to genba and problem solving to improve on SQDC. During the week, several of the teams addressed chemical hazard, minimized suspended load hazards, working at heights hazards, organized workstations and improved ergonomics. True to the philosophy of continuous improvements, Kaizen events did not stop once the week ended. In fact, they are happening regularly across GE sites around the world."
General Electric_1285,"For example, every time the team at GE Aviation’s On Wing Support  facilit y , near the city of Gimpo, South Korea, needs to hoist a LEAP  engine into place for maintenance, they are required to attach a 187-pound, U-shaped hook to the engine. The team held a kaizen that resulted in a solution; while not high-tech, a wooden box serves as a base to keep the hooks in place and eliminates the need to move the almost 200-pound hook. This design delivers an annual savings in excess of $20,000 while also improving the overall safety of the process for GE workers. This is just one example of how our teams are leveraging lean. They  r eflect how we’re running GE better and how we’re driving operational  progress and lasting cultural change."
General Electric_1290,"There is more work to be done and lean is helping us get there. How lean helps GE field crews fix   power plant  GE field crews completed more than 600 major outage jobs in more  than 60 countries in 2021, each one lasting roughly two to six weeks. This is no easy task, given the size, weight and complexity of our gas turbines. When a power plant is scheduled to go offline, service crews at GE’s FieldCore division typically gather, print and organize into binders thousands of pages specific to the technology they were summoned to service. Those documents then go to dozens of mechanics, millwrights and field engineers who fan out across the power plant."
General Electric_1295,"One copy typically sits in the job trailer, a temporary office that could be parked a quarter mile from the turbine deck where the work was taking place. The process is vintage, cumbersome and inefficient, and FieldCore work ers knew there had to be a better way. They used lean  management to find it. The GE unit brought together cross-functional teams that included mechanics and engineers from around the world. They worked together in dozens of kaizen sessions to design a digital solution that would standardize procedures and make best practices scalable and reproducible at any site anywhere in the world, from Connecticut and China to Alberta and Saudi Arabia."
General Electric_1300,"Jeremiah Smedra, an operations director at FieldCore, GE’s field services Company, using the Live Outage software, which replaced a time-consuming system that organized information in large binders. The result is Live Outage, a digital software system that makes everything field crews need accessible from portable devices in their hands, replacing the old-school binders and eliminating wasted time. The system tracks project progress in real time with status bars  for  each of the hundreds of tasks that needs to be completed and  automatically generates a daily project report. Live Outage also includes instruction checklists for each job type, as well as more than 3,000 photos and videos showing what parts look like and how to perform specific tasks. This system has already been used at approximately 15 power plants  ar ound the U.S.  He’s also quick to stress that the team isn’t finished with lean."
General Electric_1305,"FieldCore continues  to collect user feedback so they keep improving Live Outage  and further reduce waste and improve performance. GE’s wind turbine plant in Florida is  using continuous improvement to serve customers better  Workers at GE Renewable Energy’s plant in Pensacola, Florida, make  some of the most popular onshore wind turbines on the planet, GE’s 2 MW onshore wind turbines. They are also among the first at GE to embrace lean using it to strengthen safety at the site, eliminate defects and improve on-time delivery. It has also become an integral part of their work. In 2021 alone, workers at the plant held more than a dozen kaizen exercises where they were seeking to find ways to make production more flexible and resilient."
General Electric_1310,"For example, during one of the kaizens, the team focused on improving “takt time”—the amount of time workers need to complete a task at an assembly station. Understanding the takt time, and pairing that with standard work, has provided the team with an understanding of the necessary steps, the number of workers and the number of parts needed to complete an assembly operation within a given period. This work helped the plant reduce the number of build-hours it takes to produce a turbine by 340 minutes and also shortened the time a turbine spends on the production line by 100 minutes, a 6% and 12% improvement, respectively. This improvement is helping the Renewable Energy team move the product along so it can be delivered to our customers to use to power homes around the world. “Every improvement leads to another."
General Electric_1315,"That’s the lean way.”  EDUARDO OLIVIER Senior Process Improvement Manager, GE Renewable Energy  LEAN IS DRIVING IMPROVED TURNAROUND TIMES –  SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS   64  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  65    Employees at GE Healthcare’s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics unit in Cork, Ireland, are using Lean to expand manufacturing capacity by reducing turnarounds. During the GE Kaizen Week, October 2021, one of the teams focused on a filling line which places the product — contrast media solution that help doctors better image patients — into individual vials. Kaizen sessions discovered that the line was seeing around 45 hours of lost production time every week. They found the waste was a direct result of not having standard work, which was slowing down turnaround times. Together they created, tested, and implemented new standard work, including workflow and prep sequences."
General Electric_1320,"These new processes and standards have allowed them to control and plan turnarounds better and help save 15 hours per week. This expands production capacity by more than 2 million additional bottles of contrast media per year, supporting growing demand and enabling GE Healthcare to reach more patients.Product safety and quality  Lean is foundational to how we work at GE. Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost (SQDC)—in that order—help us deliver for our  customers and build a world that works. These are not simply four metrics that we are regularly reporting on, but instead are our desired set of shared instincts. At no point will an improvement in quality, delivery or cost be done at the expense of safety."
General Electric_1325,"All of the GE businesses are committed to creating safe and effective products that meet the needs of our customers and are doing this through continuously working to improve product quality. During GE’s 2022 Investor Day earlier this year, we shared how lean  is helping to transform the Company. One of the factory tours was at GE Aviation in Greenville, South Carolina, a site that began its lean journey in 2019, where the team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on high pressure turbine blades. Focusing on reducing the site’s blade delivery lead time, the team used 3P (Production Preparation Process) to improve the plant layout and create standard lines, which has improved part flow. By optimizing the layout of the plant, the team was able to reduce lead time by 13 days and is working to continue to improve and reduce by an additional 12 days."
General Electric_1330,"Through their work, overall inventory has also been reduced. Lean is making an impact and is changing the way we work for the better. Across all GE businesses, we are integrating SQDC in the design, manufacturing, testing, servicing and monitoring of all our products around the world. As we look ahead to forming three independent industry leaders with sustainability at their core, read how lean is making an impact and is changing the way each of our businesses work for the better.

SAFETY RESPONSE: AFT DIFFUSER SHIPPED WITHOUT LIFTING LUGS  An Aft Diffuser was delivered to a Gas Power site, and upon opening the shipping crate, the employees discovered the lifting lugs were missing."
General Electric_1410,"A Root Cause investigation found the drawing and BOM were appropriately marked, but the drawing notes were left off of the qualification documents. Site employees followed the established Product Safety procedures and were able to take both immediate and long term actions to safely address the situation. To correct the immediate concern, the Diffuser without lugs was lifted with lifting straps. To correct the long term concern, an update was made to the qualification drawing, the CAV definition was updated to indicate “A CAV form is a record of actual product characteristic values verified against applicable drawing, drawing notes and specification requirements. The characteristic features may be in the form of dimensions, form, function, note compliance, NDE result.”  POWER QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  GE Gas Power Quality Management System (QMS) meets all ISO 9001 Standard requirements and is designed to deliver products and services that meet our customers’ expectations."
General Electric_1415,"The following four pillars form the basis of our Quality Policy as described below:  • Zero Defect Culture: We protect our customers through a culture that accepts no defects, creates no defects, passes no defects. • Management of Change: We deliver with focus, using standard work and lean for quality. We comply with all applicable requirements and regulations. • Supply Base Quality: We partner with our suppliers and empower our employees to innovate, solve problems rapidly with rigor, and perform quality stop work when needed to protect our customers. • New Product Introduction: We deliver products and services right the first time, every time."
General Electric_1420,"We continuously improve our processes and systems leveraging past lessons and implementing sustainably. By keeping laser focus on the customer, meeting our QMS requirements, and the four pillars as our True North, while leveraging our lean approach to driving transformational improvements, we will significantly decrease our quality escapes, defects, and customer events, not only improving customer experience but also reducing CoPQ (scrap, rework, warranty costs) enabling quality as a competitive advantage driving profitable growth. One of the four pillars of our Gas Power Quality Policy is focused on improving Supply Base Quality, which in turn will improve our overall quality performance and, ultimately, customer experience. Our goal is to reduce supplier escapes (nonconforming parts) to GE by more than 25% in 2022, and we are working with our suppliers to drive step function improvements across their operations. A recent success story is a partnership with a critical U.S.-based supplier of highly technical processes."
General Electric_1425,"By embracing continuous improvement and adapting their processes to deliver better quality for GE, they improved their internal yield and lowered their escapes to GE by 95%. One specific example of improvement is the remediation of Aft Tip Cooling Hole Back Wall Strikes (BWS) on Stage 1 Blades. A BWS can create thin walls and concentrated stress that can lead to cracking. This supplier worked closely with GE’s engineering and quality teams to identify root causes of defects leading to improved design and manufacturing processes. This helped minimize customer escapes and scrap despite casting variations."
General Electric_1430,"CULTURE  Leading with integrity and The Spirit & The Letter  Integrity is critical in everything we do. This is reflected in our three Leadership Behaviors—act with humility, lead with  transparency and deliver with focus—always with unyielding integrity. These behaviors, along with our employee code  of conduct, The Spirit & The Letter, set the foundation for our compliance program, where we expect our leaders and all our employees to personally drive a culture of integrity everywhere we do business. Leadership behaviors  GE’s Leadership Behaviors form the foundation of our culture. For us at GE, these are more than just words; they are changing the way we work and  signify a meaningful shift in our culture."
General Electric_1435,"These Leadership Behaviors are instrumental in driving engagement throughout our businesses, particularly related to lean. ACT WITH HUMILITY  Humility helps us recognize what we do not know. Ask questions, then listen carefully. • We embrace a culture of respect which values inclusive teams and diverse perspectives. • We actively listen to internal and external sources."
General Electric_1440,"• We learn from our shortcomings as much as we celebrate our wins. “Respect isn’t about titles; it is about treating everyone well and working together as a team. When we listen to each other, we can learn from each other’s experiences and expertise. Humility is about acknowledging lessons learned; it isn’t a sign of weakness. We are all human.”  TRENTON SCHOONOVER  Clinical Multimedia Content Specialist, Virtual Clinical Applications Team  GE Healthcare LEAD WITH TRANSPARENCY  Transparency makes us call it like we see it, highlighting the good and the bad in  equal measure."
General Electric_1445,"• We embrace candor, saying what we think, not what people want to hear. • We share information so we can solve problems. • We contribute to each other’s development in a constructive way. “Transparency and integrity go hand-in-hand, mutually supportive in creating a shared space of doing the right thing, all the time, whether actively seen or acknowledged, without fear or favor.”  BRIAN SELBY  Asia General Manager GE Hydro Solutions DELIVER WITH FOCUS  Focus helps us prioritize what we will and will not do. • We put safety first."
General Electric_1450,"• We prioritize our work, maximizing our impact. • We measure performance through the lens of our customers. • We are committed to continuous improvement always in search of a better way. “Within our complex, multi-channel go-to-market business, 100% compliant commercial transactions are simply part of the customer-centered equation and a fundamental enabler to executing on opportunities of all size and shape.”  TOM HOFERER  General Manager-Unison Industries GE Aviation  Culture survey  In the first quarter of 2022, we conducted our second annual enterprise-wide culture survey to gauge our progress on our Leadership Behaviors, as well as  areas such as integrity, safety and lean. While there was expected variability in the results among our businesses related to certain topics, a Company-wide view of trends confirmed GE’s strong foundation in compliance efforts."
General Electric_1455,"The survey also reflected that we still have work to do on diversity and inclusion, though our leadership commitment to both is evident and has contributed to an improvement in these results compared to last year. This year again, safety questions scored high, yet we are focused on driving further action so that our front-line feels as strongly about our safety efforts as the overall Company, including management (see pages 86-89). Employees identified progress on personal and career growth, while candor and transparency remain as areas of opportunity. We believe listening and gaining these insights drive improvement, in both our business and our culture. 70  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  71   The Spirit & The Letter  Our integrity anchor is our robust employee code of conduct, The Spirit  & The Letter (S&L)."
General Electric_1460,"As the name suggests, this code of conduct is intended to hold our employees to a higher standard above and beyond simply following the letter of the law. We expect our employees and our Board of Directors to comply with the spirit of these policies and our Company values. Available for download in 21 languages, the S&L sets forth core employee and manager integrity expectations and summarizes our key Company-wide compliance policies. At GE, salaried employees are expected to affirm their commitment to abide by the S&L by completing the Spirit & Letter Acknowledgement at the time of hiring and then again every year subject to local labor law restrictions. In 2021, 98% of eligible employees completed the Spirit & Letter Acknowledgement."
General Electric_1465,"GE also requires its third parties (including distributors, suppliers, agents and partners) to comply with relevant aspects of the S&L and, as necessary, will educate those third parties about applicable policy requirements. The S&L and its accompanying policies address the full spectrum of integrity and compliance issues across GE’s global value chain. In 2021, GE published its latest version of the S&L. In response to an evolving workforce, we designed the latest S&L to be easy for different learners and workers to digest on any device. Accordingly, we made the S&L available both for downloading as well as for interactive, mobile-friendly browsing."
General Electric_1470,"The interactive version is directly accessible to employees through our GE Integrity Mobile App and includes embedded links to key policies, resources and videos for compliance help on-the-go. Philip Bradshaw working on a 7HA.03 rotor and blade stand in Greenville, SC, USA. Within the S&L framework, there are 19 core policies to help employees perform their jobs and navigate key regulatory areas under compliance. As these policies are intended for our entire employee population, we most recently updated all polices in 2021 to be simpler, principle-based and easier to understand and follow. Our policies adopt a practical layout for efficient navigation."
General Electric_1475,"The information is organized as follows:  • What to Know – states GE’s commitments in the specific policy area and provides helpful context on why the policy matters. • How to Comply – covers the specific role and responsibilities employees need to follow to be compliant with GE’s expectations. • Get Help – lists valuable, relevant resources for additional guidance on the policy topic and information on how to raise concerns. Key terms in the policies are captured in a dedicated definitions section, and all policies contain information on where to go for additional assistance. These policies are augmented by 22 Enterprise Standards, which set forth the core programmatic expectations for the businesses in all of our significant compliance risk areas."
General Electric_1480,"Each Enterprise Standard defines the specific risks that businesses must document and address, outlines auditable controls, and requires, among other things, that the businesses have appropriate mechanisms in place to monitor those controls. These Enterprise Standards were developed and launched in 2020 and, together with our policies, will be periodically refreshed as necessary and appropriate, including to incorporate lessons learned and findings from investigations and internal audits. THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER CORE POLICIES  • Acceptable Use  • Anti-Money Laundering  • Conflicts of Interest  • Cybersecurity  • EHS  • Fair Competition  • Human Rights  • Improper Payments Prevention  • Insider Trading and  Stock Tipping  • Intellectual Property • International Trade Compliance  • Open Reporting  • Privacy  • Quality  • Reporting and Recordkeeping  • Respectful Workplace  • Security  • Supplier Relationships  • Working with Governments  Our commitment to integrity and open reporting serves as the foundation for GE to deliver on its other commitments and to help build a world that works. READ THE SPIRIT & THE LETTER  READ OUR EHS POLICY  READ OUR OPEN REPORTING POLICY  READ OUR RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE POLICY ALWAYS WITH UNYIELDING INTEGRITY  GE’s Ethics & Compliance program  GE’s Ethics & Compliance program focuses on prevention, detection and response. It begins with GE leadership’s  personal engagement on integrity."
General Electric_1485,"GE leaders across the businesses personally drive a culture of integrity everywhere GE operates by leading by example, incentivizing compliance and promoting open reporting. This culture is supported by a robust Ethics & Compliance program. To ensure the program is evolving as new risks emerge, GE relies on a team of legal and functional experts to help us stay ahead of significant compliance risks and a changing regulatory landscape. Compliance training & communications  Each GE business uses a focused training and communications plan to  educate employees about the risks that are associated with their work. With a broad, global workforce across multiple business segments, plus changing workforce demographics and modes of communication, the GE program requires constant reinvention and customization by each GE business to stay relevant."
General Electric_1490,"Salaried new hires across all GE businesses receive a streamlined basic compliance training course. Additional training on key risk areas is provided to targeted employee groups based on risk. Each GE business also reinforces these learnings through a variety of communications, including leadership messages, newsletters, integrity campaigns, videos, infographics and embedded messaging within various digital tools. We invest in refreshed content on an ongoing basis, and business training and communication plans are adjusted annually based on the output of our enterprise compliance risk assessment. Voice of integrity: open reporting  Open reporting is a cornerstone of GE’s commitment to integrity."
General Electric_1495,"Every employee is responsible for integrity, and GE expects its leaders to foster an environment in which employees are encouraged to raise integrity concerns without fear of retaliation. Employees serve as the best line of defense for the early detection of potential issues, and open reporting activity is one of the best indicators of a culture of integrity and employee engagement on compliance priorities. GE manages employee concern reporting through its Global Open Reporting & Ombuds Program. Under the program, employees are required to submit concerns regarding potential violations of law, regulation or GE policy through one of the available open reporting channels, including managers, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Ombuds and anonymously through webform. The program serves as a safe forum for whistleblowers—GE understands that it can be difficult for some employees to come forward with their concerns and the anonymous reporting channel is a critical pillar of the open reporting program."
General Electric_1500,"Each business has at least one full-time ombudsperson and, in addition, a network of part-time employees across the globe to whom concerns can be raised. In 2021, 2,355 concerns were raised, 2,275 of which were closed, with the remaining cases pending ongoing investigations and further review. GE fully examines every integrity concern raised and takes necessary remedial actions where appropriate. During the investigation process, GE:  • Forms an independent and objective investigation team;  • Obtains the facts through interviews and/or reviews of documents;  • Reaches conclusions, whenever possible, from the facts the team is able to obtain;  • Recommends corrective action, if necessary; and  • Provides the person who raised the original concern (if that person is known) with feedback on the outcome, while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of all involved (to the extent possible). Certain cases are treated with special care depending on the individuals or content involved."
General Electric_1505,"Concerns related to senior executives or Company officers must be escalated, as must be any complaint that could materially impact financial reporting or controls, or that relate to federal securities law matters. Finally, the Significant Cases Committee (SCC) is responsible for performing monthly reviews of high-risk open reporting investigations across the Company. The members of the SCC include the Chief Audit Executive and Vice Presidents of Compliance and Global Investigations. The SCC reviews the significant case criteria annually to ensure both internal and external risks are considered. 72  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  73   GE measures the strength of its open reporting program using a  number of metrics, which are reviewed at least monthly throughout the year."
General Electric_1510,"The program tracks the average number of days that it takes to close each investigation raised through open reporting, targeting resolution within 60 days of being reported. Businesses are required to escalate to the SCC any cases open for longer than 90 days that come through open reporting channels. The program also measures cases per 1,000 employees, which enables year-over-year comparisons within and across businesses, and enables us to control for any headcount changes. In addition, we track confirmation and anonymity rates, which are important to understand the health of our program. Retaliation for raising a concern or for participating in an integrity investigation is strictly prohibited, and violations are dealt with seriously and swiftly, up to and including termination."
General Electric_1515,"Compliance risk mitigation  GE’s Ethics & Compliance team runs an annual assessment that focuses on evaluating the inherent risks and the strength of our internal controls across all our businesses. The assessment process asks each business to benchmark its own compliance programs against the 19 Spirit & Letter policies, which the Ethics & Compliance team includes in an overall assessment as to how GE performs in each key policy area. Insights from this process are used in many aspects of the compliance program including by identifying additional training needs, control improvements, and other areas that may need remediation efforts. The compliance risk assessment also feeds into the GE Enterprise Risk Management process, as appropriate. Compliance governance  GE has a rigorous compliance governance process, both at a corporate and business level."
General Electric_1520,"Each business holds a quarterly review board meeting, which is attended by the most senior business leaders, including the CEO, during which their risk assessment, mitigation efforts, and other compliance issues are discussed. Additionally, each business meets with Company’s Chief Compliance Officer twice per year to discuss its risk assessment, any program weaknesses or enhancements, and any compliance trends; and reports its most significant enterprise risks and compliance issues to the Company’s Audit Committee on an annual basis. At a corporate level, the Chief Compliance Officer holds two to three meetings per year with the Company’s most senior officers to discuss significant program updates, open reporting trends, significant investigations, and business updates on key risk areas. In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer and Vice President of Investigations report on the same issues to the Audit Committee periodically. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY  GE has long taken a leading role in pushing for transparency  and integrity in the global marketplace."
General Electric_1525,"Our stance against improper payments in business transactions is a key element of our compliance program and represents a core belief in how we do business. In short, GE prohibits bribery in all business dealings, in every country around the world, with both governments and private sector. This prohibition applies to GE employees, as well as external parties who work for or represent GE. We maintain strong controls aimed at preventing and detecting bribery. GE’s approach to compliance in this critical area is multifaceted."
General Electric_1530,"Among its key features are:  • Corporate policies and procedures that reflect the Company’s approach by prohibiting improper payments in every transaction, whether with a government or with a private party  • Extensive controls, including thorough due diligence, careful screening and training on GE policies for third-party intermediaries such as distributors, service providers, and commercial agents and representatives  • Heightened attention to key risk areas such as gifts and entertainment, travel and living expenses, donations, and facilitating payments  • Prompt investigation and remediation of any concerns  • Extensive training of GE employees on improper payments  • Robust internal controls and accounting processes designed to detect and prevent violations of Company policy relating to improper payment risks and to ensure accurate books and records relating to transactions  • Increased emphasis and enhanced due diligence concerning improper risk associated with mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures  THE IMPORTANCE OF STRONG  ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE  Greater attention is being paid to the effectiveness of corporate compliance programs in preventing improper payments. The Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have issued a resource guide on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) that endorses a strong compliance program. The UK Bribery Act, the Clean Company Act in Brazil, the Sapin II Law in France, the 231 Decree in Italy and the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines similarly highlight the need for a strong program. As part of the compliance program at GE, operating with a strong anti-corruption program is a critical component in how we do business."
General Electric_1535,"Anti-Corruption Policy Privacy and cybersecurity  At GE, ensuring the security of our information, systems, products, and network is, and always will be, a top priority. GE is committed to protecting information about our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our company,  as well as the technology resources GE provides to its employees and contractors. We have adopted a “defense in depth” approach, in which multiple layers of security controls are placed throughout our systems, and a security by design approach, to build security into our products, both of which enable GE to proactively protect against and respond to a dynamic cyber threat landscape. As such, GE has implemented detailed cybersecurity and information protection policies. GE’S CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK  At GE, ensuring the security of our information, systems, products,  and network is, and always will be, a top priority."

Each cyber function (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover) is managed by defined governance, risk assessment, control implementation, control effectiveness monitoring and metrics. GE has implemented a layered defense approach to security, which combines multiple mitigating security controls to protect our resources and information and improve our cyber resiliency. Our central cybersecurity framework reaches our shared services operations and the businesses to optimize our protection based on industry specific requirements. We devote substantial resources to maintaining an information technology infrastructure that implements physical, administrative, and technical controls designed to protect information stored on GE’s networks, including customer information, personal information, intellectual property and proprietary information."
General Electric_1545,"Information that could result in a significant harm to GE if lost, or intentionally or accidentally misused, is subject to enhanced security controls. GE’s most sensitive information is identified and included within the scope of GE’s crown jewel program through an annual review and analysis of GE’s critical business information and programs. In addition, we have committed resources and implemented processes to more effectively prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. GE’s central cyber crisis management team exercises, tests and continually improves our cyber crisis management plan through rigorous tabletops and simulations at the enterprise and business levels. Working with GE legal, communications, privacy, and compliance teams, the central cyber crisis management team also addresses any security concerns or incidents that could present an enterprise risk to GE, which includes third party supplier incidents."
General Electric_1550,"These measures reflect GE’s long-term commitment to protecting our employees, serving our customers and preserving shareholder value. Despite these measures, GE may not be able to successful prevent or defend against all cyber-related attacks. GE’s approach to product cybersecurity includes lifecycle management, vulnerability management, customer notifications, incident response, issuing security bulletins and advisories, and a dedicated channel for receiving and responding to vulnerability reports. We have also developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products. PROTECTING GE’S DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM  The increasing degree of interconnectedness among companies and their affiliates, partners, suppliers and customers underscores the need for companies to evaluate cybersecurity threats not only to their own internal networks, but also to the larger ecosystem in which they operate."
General Electric_1555,"We understand that protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information on GE’s network necessarily extends to business partners who are afforded access to such information. GE contractually requires its suppliers to appropriately secure and maintain their information technology systems and protect GE’s information on their systems. GE performs security assessments on certain suppliers based on a risk assessment and rating process performed by GE’s cyber team. Higher risk suppliers are subject to more frequent reassessments and onsite assessments. 74  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  75   GE understands our employees serve an important role in helping  to safeguard GE’s information and systems."

GE businesses provide additional training tailored to their customer requirements, regulatory obligations and industry risks. We recognize that technology and the nature of its threats and risks are changing, and GE will continue to evolve to meet those changes. GE believes collaboration is important for effective cybersecurity solutions—bringing together the best minds and the best ideas. Global interconnectedness means that no one company or country operates alone."
General Electric_1565,"We continuously seek to engage with our regulators, customers, suppliers, employees and industry colleagues to improve cybersecurity collaboratively. In addition, we engage in public private partnerships, such as information sharing and analysis centers, to share actionable cyber threat indicators. These activities have resulted in improved capabilities that are quicker and more effective in responding to dynamic threats.

We will continuously look to improve the depth and breadth of our diversity data. Following the updates to the voluntary self-identification categories and selections for employees in the U.S., in the future this might include other voluntary self-identification data like sexual orientation and gender identity. Since 2020, we have seen growth at the leadership level for both women globally (+1.2%) and for total U.S. race and ethnic minority (+1.7%).

PART III | OUR COMMITMENTS  GE respects our people, our planet  and our communities  As a global company that services customers in over 175 countries, we are mindful of the impact our  actions have on the world—whether it be the people who make up our global workforce or those of our suppliers, the communities where we live and work, or the planet itself. In line with our sustainability efforts toward continuous improvement for purposeful outcomes, we have prioritized the following commitments:  • Protect the safety of our people and those who do work on  our behalf."
General Electric_1755,"• Be responsible stewards of the environment. • Maintain a strong EHS and environmental compliance program. • Make progress toward our climate change emission goals and ambitions for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. • Reinforce our commitment to product quality and safety. • Pursue environmental stewardship and circular economy in the design of our products."
General Electric_1760,• Invest in returning contaminated properties to protective reuse for communities with a priority on environmental justice communities. • Respect the human rights of our own workforce and all of those in our value chain. • Hold suppliers accountable for an ethical supply chain. • Respect employee’s rights to freedom of association. • Transform our communities through healthcare and humanitarian support and shape the diverse workforce of tomorrow by leveraging the power of GE through the GE Foundation.
General Electric_1765,"Our commitments start on the shop   floor and grow to encompass   commitments that reach into our  communities and across the   planet. With every decision,   we seek to lead with   integrity in all that   we do. GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  85   84  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  Safety  Putting safety first  With approximately 168,0006 employees and operations in over  175 countries, GE’s impact across the globe is immense. Looking after  the safety of our people and those who work on our behalf—so that they can fulfill GE’s mission of building a world that works—is a top priority for the company. Over time, we have seen an overall downward trend in our Injury & Illness rates, which compare favorably to  data from the U.S. Bureau of  Labor Statistics."
General Electric_1770,"However, we are not satisfied: because even one injury  is too many. Regrettably, in 2021, four individuals lost their lives doing work for GE. While our number of fatal events has decreased since 2020, each fatality is a tragedy that touches the lives of families, friends and co-workers. There’s more we need to do to ensure that those who work for us or do work on our behalf make it home safely each day. GE leadership has taken significant steps to drive improvement across three areas: resource prioritization, leadership focus and company-wide attention on the importance of safety."
General Electric_1775,"In 2021, GE launched the GE Safety Council to catalyze injury prevention efforts and support the further embedding of safety as a core attribute in each of our businesses. The Council complements our rigorous EHS program and includes EHS leaders from each of our businesses and from Corporate. Leading the Council is Francisco Benavides, who joined GE in late 2021 as GE’s Chief Safety Officer. With three decades of experience across a range of industries including aerospace, mining and utilities, Francisco’s mission as Chief Safety Officer is to further the company’s safety goals and improve overall performance. At each of our businesses, there is CEO-level accountability for safety."
General Electric_1780,"Further reflecting GE’s prioritization of improving health and safety in the workplace, a modifier for safety performance was added to our annual bonus program, in addition to financial metrics. As the company embarks on its planned transition to three, independent global public companies, our teams remain focused on driving continuous improvement to ensure that safety comes first in all that we do within each business and across the enterprise. LEVERAGING LEAN TO IMPROVE SAFETY  Our business teams have been leveraging lean as a critical tool to help prevent events and drive safety as a core operational attribute. In 2021, the Gas Power team defined their Safety Hoshin breakthrough—a lean tool—as achieving zero serious incidents. The team utilizes standard work to evaluate every Potentially Severe Event (PSE) as a serious incident."
General Electric_1785,"This starts with the frontline team openly reporting PSEs, escalating to leadership, completing investigations within 15 days and driving learnings and actions across the business. A strong partnership between EHS and lean in Healthcare has been instrumental in identifying synergies, embedding standard work and driving process improvements across the business. While in Aviation, each kaizen event is expected to generate at least five safety improvements. GE Renewable Energy’s Vision Safe program continued throughout 2021 for employees and contractors, with a focus on Plan-Do-Review, which helps ensure jobs are completed safely every day. Using lean tools, more than 14,000 EHS Genba Walks have been held globally in 2021 to improve processes and leadership engagement."

Managing safety risks wherever we work  Our safety expectations extend beyond our own operations to all  places where we work—customer sites, field services, and at our project installation and construction locations—and to all those who work on our behalf."
General Electric_1800,"Although our safety expectations do not change, managing risks across various operations sites is inherently different. The four fatal events we regrettably experienced in 2021 were contractor fatalities. As we have evaluated our performance over the past few years, we have identified contractor safety as a key focus area for improvement. We have implemented a set of standards for contractor prequalification, as well as a system to manage the process globally. We review training and competency expectations, programmatic elements for high-risk operations such as working at heights, electrical work and executing lifts, as well as performance metrics."
General Electric_1805,"Using these standards, we can assess capabilities and help drive safe execution in alignment with our expectations. When we find defects in programs or competency, we may partner with the contractor to provide risk mitigation plans or basic competency in certain areas. We have also reinvigorated our incident investigation process. Ensuring we are recording and learning from both employee and contractor events, as well as putting mitigation plans in place to prevent them from recurring, is part of our overall commitment to a safe working environment for all. GE’s Life Saving Principles (LSPs) illustrate critical steps to stay safe in certain hazardous situations."
General Electric_1810,"These steps are never to be circumvented. All employees and contractors are empowered to stop work if they have any concerns about the task they are performing. These LSP documents, represented visually and in more than 20 languages, are widely available, posted at our operations and are used to orient our contractors and partners, specifically at our project sites, to GE’s most fundamental expectations. Although we believe GE’s safety program is a commercial differentiator, we don’t believe safety is proprietary.

Reflecting on the assembly of LEAP’s compressor module, a team of technicians at the plant focused on the repetitive work of installing 48 thumbnail-size nuts on a component that requires a blind installation. Leveraging lean principles and tools, a new tightening tool was designed. The technicians decided to add a small mirror to the wrench, allowing them to see into the module."
General Electric_1820,"The new, longer extension also allowed them to keep their arms and shoulders in a more neutral position. In addition to being more ergonomic, the new tool has reduced the time it takes to complete the task. A similar story unfolded at a GE Healthcare site in Beijing, where technicians improved the final stretch of the manufacturing process for C-arms, semi-circular imaging systems used during surgery. An ongoing ergonomic hurdle was the installation of wheel covers on the machines, often requiring technicians to lie on the floor to complete the task. A team of local operators and supervisors held a kaizen event, at which they proposed designing a jig that could improve the  work."
General Electric_1825,"Within a few weeks, they had come up with a new design: a device that consisted of a 3D-printed mounting base sporting two screwdrivers that were pre-aligned with the thread holes. Through testing, the team found the new setup helped to shave around 15 minutes off the job, no lying down required. But there was still room for improvement and one team member made a suggestion— bringing in a lifting platform from another area in the plant. This would allow them to install the wheel covers at waist height. With the elimination of squatting, they had reduced the task’s REBA score, an ergonomic assessment tool that evaluates the risks to the  body associated with certain jobs, by 86%."
General Electric_1830,"Both the Aviation team and the Healthcare team were named finalists in the Ergo Cup, a prestigious competition run by the Applied Ergonomics Society and the Ergonomics Center of North Carolina.

General Electric_1835,Our EHS principles include:  • Complying with EHS laws and GE standards. • Managing and reducing risk. • Reducing our environmental footprint. • Monitoring and evaluating performance. • Driving operational accountability.
General Electric_1840,"We maintain a Global EHS Policy and an EHS Enterprise Standard, which set expectations for the GE businesses with responsibility for day-to-day environmental risk mitigation, compliance assurance and EHS culture. Layered on this foundation are the Core Requirement and Technical Standard documents that cover specific safety risk areas such as work at height, confined space, electrical safety and environmental risk areas, including air emissions; spill and release management, prevention and response; and waste and water management. Our employees complete more than one million EHS courses annually covering regulatory and non-regulatory topics and translated into appropriate languages. The courses are designed and maintained centrally by a team that ensures accuracy, accessibility, and compliance with EHS regulations and GE’s standards. The assignments are done locally by EHS professionals who are able to develop targeted, roles-based training for relevant employees."
General Electric_1845,"We assess the EHS impacts of our businesses globally using an enterprise-wide system of record for the majority of our EHS data, allowing for robust analysis and trending to be done in order to learn and improve. We track industry standard key performance indicators (KPIs), such as injuries, illnesses, significant environmental events, training completion, and regulatory findings and closures. Framework 2.0, a key element of our EHS management system, measures individual operations against a series of self-assessment questions on environment, health and safety topics. In the environmental defenses element of our framework, organizations are evaluated on air emission sources, air pollution control equipment, water sources and discharges, wastewater treatment equipment and operating conditions, and hazardous and industrial waste collection, management and shipping practices. The implementation of these expectations is carried out by a robust network of professionals supporting our sites, services and projects across the globe."
General Electric_1850,"Compliance is monitored by these teams of EHS professionals and through a robust reporting and metrics structure. GE drives an open-reporting culture across compliance and controllership functions, including EHS, in order for issues to be elevated and addressed. Our EHS data is published internally at least quarterly and is available real-time through a system of dashboards maintained at the company and business levels. This proactive use of KPIs and data underscores GE’s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement. EHS performance is reviewed by senior leaders across the company, by our CEO in strategy sessions and by the Board of Directors through the Governance committee."
General Electric_1855,"This layering of review ensures visibility and accountability, cornerstones of our EHS program. Audits are conducted at a frequency that reflects the inherent risk and performance of the operation.

General Electric_1900,"The program meets greenhouse gas protocol set by the World Resources Institute for measuring and managing Scope 2 emissions. ENERGY EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS  Lynn’s power plant was first built in the 1940s and has been simultaneously supplying electrical and thermal energy through a process called co-generation. The power plant’s four boilers and three steam turbine generator sets were de-commissioned at the end of March 2020. A new central heating plant opened in a refurbished building with new, natural gas boilers, providing steam for heating, manufacturing processes and test operations. By right-sizing the power generation facility for current site needs, it’s more efficient and uses less natural gas and electricity."
General Electric_1905,"Since 2020, the Lynn site has decreased its site-wide GHG emissions by 52% by not only investing in the new steam plant system, but also by installing onsite solar panel arrays and partnering with the local utility to take advantage of energy efficiency rebate projects. A new chip compactor was installed after the lean event in Pune, India. USING LEAN TO REDUCE COSTS AND ENERGY  In 2021, select GE Aviation locations participated in developing Green value stream maps at their respective sites. Green value stream mapping assessments are targeted kaizen events that assess the current state of a process of operation and seeks to identify green “waste” opportunities. These opportunities are focused on energy consumption, water usage, waste generation, material waste, transportation and biodiversity."
General Electric_1910,"Our Pune, India, team was able to identify over 106 opportunities to reduce its environmental impact by reducing waste in their auto cleanline, Ipsen furnace and flat belt grinding operations. Since the event was held in October 2021, the site has implemented several of the opportunities identified, including optimizing the loading pattern and batch sizes in the Ipsen furnace, saving 20% energy usage on the equipment. HEALTHCARE  GE Healthcare has an ESG governance structure that develops and  leads its business sustainability strategy. One team within that structure is a carbon working group, led by the Chief Supply Chain Officer and focused on delivering on our commitment to an absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by at least 50% by 2030, versus a 2019 baseline. Our carbon reduction strategy includes reducing greenhouse gas releases from our facilities, shifting to renewable energy sources and transitioning to an electric or hybrid fleet."
General Electric_1915,"As part of our drive to eliminate energy waste, we carried out eight-week energy reduction workshops for 42 of our larger sites and sites reported on their carbon reduction roadmaps as part of an annual governance review. In 2021, we also developed a roadmap to reduce emissions from our fleet of over 10,000 vehicles and started the process of transitioning vehicles in Europe to electric and hybrid options. We’re also exploring mobility and other efficiency options to further reduce the environmental footprint of our fleet.

Learn more  PARIS-ALIGNED LOBBYING REPORT  Consistent with the policy advocacy previously discussed, GE focuses its climate lobbying efforts on being a constructive voice in advancing policies that further a successful energy transition—the decarbonization of energy while growing access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy."
General Electric_2015,"Our lobbying activities are in furtherance of GE’s climate change goals, including the science and goals expressed in the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we support policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development. For example, GE has worked closely with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to establish the first-ever CO 2 emissions standards for aircraft. GE has been on the record in support  of both President Biden’s infrastructure initiative and clean energy tax credits, including launching a public advocacy campaign on the latter. GE engages in public policy discussions that impact our company, our workers and our communities in areas such as aviation, energy, healthcare, international trade and investment, tax, data governance, rule of law and government procurement. These areas overlap with climate goals and we seek to inform discussions by promoting thoughtful civil discourse grounded in strong, fact-based and reasoned analysis."
General Electric_2020,"We work in partnership with governments because we know that tackling the world’s biggest challenges is only possible if governments and industry work together as partners. GE employees engage with public officials at all levels of government in the United States and in some countries outside of the United States. GE conducts lobbying activities in compliance with applicable laws governing such activities and files appropriate reports. For example, in 2021, we engaged with the Biden administration and members of Congress in more than 120 meetings where we discussed various aspects of the energy transition. Of these, we had more than 20 meetings with staff of the U.S. Congress that included the full scope of GE’s businesses, presenting a “One GE” position on the importance of reducing carbon emissions while promoting sustainable development."
General Electric_2025,"OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC POLICY AND LOBBYING  The Governance Committee, composed solely of independent directors, oversees the Company’s public policy and government relations activities, including policies and guidelines regarding political contributions and lobbying activities, and external reporting on such activities. This includes political and campaign contributions as well as any contributions to trade associations and other tax-exempt and similar organizations that may engage in political activity, including climate-related public policy. For more information on Board oversight of public policy, see  page 57 . In addition to robust board oversight, GE has significant management-level oversight over environmental and political activities. Our climate change and energy transition programs and policies are overseen by GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)."
General Electric_2030,"The CSO has day-to-day responsibility for climate change and sustainability matters and works closely with the Head of Government Affairs and Policy, GE’s International Market team, and representatives in relevant businesses- allowing for even greater synergies and alignment of our lobbying activities with our climate strategy. As described elsewhere, the CSO also works closely with environmental NGOs, think tanks, industry coalitions, trade associations and other stakeholder to advance these policies. Solving the world’s greatest challenge with the industry’s leading portfolio of technologies. Photo Credit: Rich Crowder  GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer and GE’s Head of Government Affairs and Policy are regularly briefed on and help develop our policy priorities and activities; and our Governance Committee also receives formal reports on our political activities. To proactively develop and advance climate change policy positions and related strategy consistent with GE’s climate change goals, we leverage the experience of a broad cross-functional team, inclusive of representatives from our Sustainability, Legal, Government Affairs, Risk, Financial and Investor Relations groups as well as advice received in consultation with outside specialists."
General Electric_2035,"We leveraged this cross-functional team in the preparation of this report on Paris-aligned lobbying, which was supervised by our Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Government Affairs and Policy, and reviewed by the Governance Committee. ADVOCACY THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS  We support associations that are leading on climate change solutions, policies and technologies, including nonprofit organizations and trade associations. We partner formally and informally with numerous associations and NGOs around the world that share the mission of addressing climate change, decarbonizing industrial sectors and promoting sustainable development. For example:  • GE is one of the founding strategic partners of the non-profit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), an original member of its Business Environmental Leadership Council, and a member of its Board of Directors. GE participates in C2ES research and supports C2ES’ mission to “advance strong policy and action to reduce GHGs, promote clean energy and strengthen resilience to climate impacts.”  • GE is an active member of the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and sits on its Board of Directors."
General Electric_2040,"ACP is the leading federation of renewable energy companies expediating the advancement of clean energy in the United States. • GE is a member of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a nonpartisan collaboration of more than 80 businesses and organizations building federal policy support to enable economywide, commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture technologies. Examples of collaboration with diverse public and private stakeholders in 2021 and 2022 are summarized on  pages 31, 40  and 49. TRADE ASSOCIATIONS  As one of the largest and most diverse companies in the world, GE belongs to many associations in which we work with our industry partners. These associations engage in advocacy at the state and federal levels in key jurisdictions around the world on a range of policy topics including energy and climate."
General Electric_2045,"Consistent with our direct lobbying, we believe our work with trade associations is in furtherance of, and consistent with, GE’s climate change goals, including the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. As a general proposition, we are seeing our trade associations increasingly move in constructive directions toward rallying their members toward climate change and energy transition solutions. For example, we are pleased that, to the best of our knowledge, none of our trade associations with key roles on climate (as discussed below) argued against EPA’s regulatory authority to address climate change before the Supreme Court in West Virginia v. EPA, and that certain GE associations filed briefs in support of EPA. GE’s policy team works with our trade associations on a regular basis to influence constructive action toward these goals. Annually, we meet with our major U.S. trade associations to review our policy priorities, including stressing the importance of each to align with the Paris Climate Agreement goals and be a force for positive action toward decarbonization and sustainable development goals."
General Electric_2050,"This is not to say that all trade associations are moving at the same pace, that we expect them to necessarily agree on all policy positions set forth, or that GE agrees fully on all views and positions. There is room for a reasonable divergence of views on various policies and approaches while still constructively advancing efforts toward decarbonization. GE’s role in these circumstances is to be a force of positive direction and to express the views of a multinational industrial company in promoting constructive engagement by the trade associations on these issues. To be clear, GE does not and will not use trade associations as a cloak for climate change policies inconsistent with our own positions detailed above. Where we see trade associations potentially advocate for a position different than ours with regard to climate policy, including if a position were misaligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, in the first instance we reach out to the trade association to assert influence toward alignment."
General Electric_2055,"Our goal is to communicate in real time and express our positions toward positive change. On these occasions, we have typically found fair reception of our input by the relevant trade associations. We believe this is the better approach to withdrawing membership when disagreements arise as our continued membership in the trade association usually positions us to influence the trade association’s policy positions in ways that better align with our objectives, or because we believe that our continued work with the trade association will help advance other important policy objectives aligned with our interests. At the same time, we would reserve the option of terminating our membership and/or withdrawing financial support if the misalignment with a particular position the trade association supports outweighs the overall benefits to GE of being a member. GE’S POSITION ON CLIMATE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS  GE is monitoring emerging climate and ESG disclosure  regulations in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions."
General Electric_2060,"GE supports efforts to improve disclosure in these areas that focus on material information, help align existing reporting frameworks, and recognize the evolving maturity of this type of information and reporting across companies broadly. GE aspires to be a constructive and positive voice toward disclosure that is effective and meaningful for our stakeholders while promoting consistency in various regimes to reduce confusion and undue burdens. GE has also expressed these views to several of our trade associations engaged in these rules. 98  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  99   POSITIONS OF GE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS WITH KEY ROLES ON CLIMATE  As part of this ongoing engagement, GE during the past year undertook an effort to centrally compile a global inventory of trade associations and  other relevant organizations that GE was a member of in 2021 and that engaged in policy advocacy related to climate change. For each of those, we conducted analysis of how much work GE does with the organization and the organization’s level of policy engagement in this space."
General Electric_2065,"From this broader list, we identified several trade associations with key roles on climate where we conducted a deeper analysis of each trade association’s specific positions on climate change, and how well those positions aligned with GE’s own policy positions and with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We chose these trade associations, listed below, as the most relevant to consider for a more detailed climate position analysis based on factors such as the association’s level of activity or influence on climate-related topics, the relevance of the association’s work to particular GE businesses or markets, and our judgment about the association that would be of greatest interest to stakeholders regarding potential Paris Climate agreement alignment or misalignment. The table below provides a summary of the alignment analysis, based on reviews of available policies and positions published by the trade associations. CLIMATE CHANGE POSITION ALIGNMENT TO THE PARIS CLIMATE  AGREEMENT AND GE’S CLIMATE POSITIONS  THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES  ASSOCIATION (AIA) is a  leading voice in the aircraft, space and defense industries. The organization advocates for effective federal investments; accelerated deployment of innovative technologies; policies that enhance the aviation industries global competitiveness; and recruitment and retention efforts that support a capable and diverse 21st century workforce."

GE Aviation is also supporting industry initiatives to approve and adopt 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and investigating hydrogen as the zero-carbon fuel of the future. GE’s efforts to innovate toward a net zero 2050 ambition for aviation are further described on page 50.  BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE (BRT) is an association of chief executive officers of America’s leading companies working to promote a thriving U.S. economy and expanded opportunity for all Americans through sound policy. BRT believes addressing climate change and its impacts demands a robust, coordinated effort with a sound policy portfolio."
General Electric_2085,"BRT believes, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world must work together to limit global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, and that the U.S. and the international community must aggressively reduce GHG emissions and create incentives for developing new technologies to achieve this goal. BRT notes that in 2018 the IPCC reported that limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels will be necessary to avoid some of the most severe risks associated with climate change. BRT supports a goal of reducing net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050. We played an active role with BRT at the working group level to update its climate position in 2020, which brought it more closely aligned to GE’s climate policy position and the Paris Climate Agreement. BRT has set a goal of reducing net U.S. GHG emissions by at least 80% from 2005 levels by 2050."
General Electric_2090,"The Paris Climate Agreement includes a similar goal. GE continues to work with BRT to ensure that U.S. business leaders advocate for ambitious policies in line with the U.S. commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, including how clean energy tax incentives will help keep the U.S. a leader in clean energy technology.

The NAM believes an environment and climate change agenda for the future must recognize manufacturers as the solution to emerging environmental challenges and build on the strong steps manufacturers have already taken to become more sustainable and tackle climate change; apply sound science and evidence-based approaches in new proposals; and appropriately balance the United States’ economic and environmental interests so that achieving one goal does not mean ignoring the other. The NAM recommends commencing negotiations to improve on the Paris Climate Agreement and achieve a binding global climate treaty that keeps post-industrial warming of the planet to “well below 2 degrees, and approaching 1.5 degrees.” The NAM supports a binding climate treaty to keep post-industrial warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees, and approaching 1.5 degrees. We believe these ambitions are consistent with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement."
General Electric_2125,"GE plays an active role on NAM’s environment committee and worked to update the NAM’s policy on climate in 2020, which brought it more closely aligned to GE’s climate policy position and the Paris Climate Agreement. Roger Martella, GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer, is the NAM’s Sustainability & Environmental Quality Committee Chair and Pat Byrne, CEO of GE Renewable Energy Onshore Wind, serves on the NAM’s Board of Directors. We continue to engage with the NAM on our key energy transition priorities, including onshore wind production tax credits, 45Q enhancements, and supporting production incentives for sustainable aviation fuel. For example, GE supported the clean energy tax incentives being discussed in Congress and we believe it is important for the NAM to recognize these provisions support manufacturers of clean energy power generation equipment. THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE is the world’s largest business organization representing all sizes of businesses to advocate, partner, and network on a range of topics."
General Electric_2130,The U.S. Chamber advocates for policies that help businesses create jobs and grow the United States economy. The U.S. Chamber engages on climate change policy approaches that acknowledge the cost of inaction and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy and advocates for durable solutions that leverage innovation. The U.S. Chamber has stated it supports the Biden Administration’s decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. The U.S. Chamber’s climate policy principles are:  • Support a market-based approach to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the U.S. economy  • Leverage the power of business  • Maintain U.S. leadership in climate science  • Embrace technology and innovation  • Aggressively pursue greater energy efficiency  • Promote climate resilient infrastructure  • Support trade in U.S. technologies and products  • Encourage international cooperation  • Inaction is not an action We believe the U.S. Chamber has progressed on its climate change position. This includes putting forth a comprehensive climate position that includes supporting U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement as well as calling on policymakers to act on climate.
General Electric_2135,"Additionally, the Chamber has launched a Task Force open to its membership to inform the organization’s climate policy. In 2019, GE joined the U.S. Chamber’s Task Force on Climate Action. This group was focused on helping the U.S. Chamber understand the impact of existing and future policies on businesses and how to proactively address climate change. The U.S. Chamber has made progress in recognizing the Paris Climate Agreement and being a convenor of companies and governments in pursuit of solutions to climate change at global venues such as COP27, where the Chamber is facilitating engagement between American companies and the Egyptian government. GE routinely engages with the U.S. Chamber policy experts to underscore the importance of supporting the transition to renewable energy, the need for policy support for decarbonizing gas power generation and aviation through carbon capture and alternative fuels, and how clean energy tax incentives will help build a stronger U.S. supply chain."

The components of the blade, as well as waste created in the production, can be recycled by a process of compounding or chemical recycling."
General Electric_2180,"After shredding, the material can be compounded to make pellets. The pellets can be used to produce calibrated 3D filament for FDM printer or can directly be used on a robotic arm with a mini extruder. Another option is chemical recycling, which enables the resin to depolymerize, whereby the monomers are separated from the fibres and used to make recycled resin again. From this breakthrough in recycling technology, the materials from the blades can be reused in new blades, therefore ‘closing the loop’ and bringing circular solutions to the industry (photo credit: Veolia). GE HEALTHCARE’S GOLDSEAL PROGRAM  The global refurbished medical equipment market plays a critical role in helping improve access to affordable quality healthcare."
General Electric_2185,"High-quality refurbished medical equipment is a viable diagnostic imaging option for hospitals seeking to stretch their budgets to purchase still exceptionally good equipment. There are environmental benefits of refurbishing medical imaging equipment as well. By extending the useful life of medical imaging equipment, refurbishment is a form of reuse and waste prevention, contributing to a circular economy. Refurbishment also saves the energy and the materials required to produce new equipment. For more than 20 years, GE Healthcare’s GoldSeal program has played a vital role in reducing medical imaging equipment waste by promoting and enabling the reuse of equipment and parts from de-installed imaging systems."
General Electric_2190,"After undergoing an extensive inspection and testing process, GoldSeal equipment is refurbished to meet the original system specifications. Buyers of GoldSeal MR, CT, or PET/CT products can save on acquisition costs associated with buying new equipment. Machines deemed not suitable for GoldSeal refurbishment are dismantled at end of life, and after successfully passing acceptance testing criteria, specific parts are harvested for reuse. After desirable components are harvested, as much of the residual material as possible is recycled. Depending on the system, anywhere from 82 to 100% of a system may be recyclable."
General Electric_2195,"SKJERN PAPER USES AI TO IMPROVE PRODUCT   QUALITY AND REDUCE WASTE  The only paper mill in Denmark, Skjern Paper started production  in 1967 with the idea of manufacturing paper exclusively from old newspaper, becoming an innovative leader in sustainability. Today, Skjern Paper is owned by Buur Invest A/S and manufactures 75,000 tons of paper and board products each year from 100% recycled fiber. Through the implementation of GE Digital’s Proficy CSense software solution, the team has been able to decrease scrap and chemical usage while increasing production capability.

Water usage captured includes potable, process and sanitary water, as well as once-through cooling water from freshwater sources. To track GE’s water usage, GE facilities use a robust, global database to manage our reporting, including quantities of water withdrawn from each of the following  source categories:  • Public/commercial  • Fresh surface water  • Rainwater  • Brackish surface water or seawater  • On-site groundwater well  Before – Wet Air  Tightness Test   After – Dry Differential  Pressure Test  Beijing has been subject to water scarcity in recent decades.11 At present, 73% of municipal water in Beijing comes from the South-to- North Water Diversion Project, which involves drawing water from southern rivers and supplying it to the dry north. The cost of municipal water in Beijing is also higher than many other cities."
General Electric_2220,"12 In 2021, GE Healthcare’s manufacturing site in Beijing investigated water reduction  opportunities in its production process. One of the production steps when manufacturing surgery tubes is to verify the air tightness by a leakage test. This involves submerging the surgery tube in a water tank. After several attempts, the team successfully replaced the previous leakage test with a dry differential pressure test, reducing fresh water usage by about 21.7 tons per year.

First, we are committed to ensuring all communities where we operate  realiz e the strongest environmental protection from our activities. Thus, we work to achieve environmental protection standards for all communities to the same extent regardless of the scope of applicable local regulations, if any."
General Electric_2230,"Second, we strongly believe access to affordable, reliable and  sustainable electricity  is critical to reducing poverty and hunger and  promoting access to education and healthcare for all people. As described on page 22, we are passionate about succeeding in the energ y transition in a way that brings reliable electricity to everyone  in a sustainable way. Our technology plays a key role in helping governments reach their Paris Agreement goals, while also promoting the UN SDGs, which we believe are the blueprint to achieving a better and more sustainable future for all. (See pages 7-10). Third, we support policies to clean up and redevelop idle contaminated  proper ties into new hubs of economic growth and job creation."
General Electric_2235,"As described below, we are implementing an initiative to invest in remediating brownfields—contaminated vacant properties that could serve better purposes once cleaned up—particularly for public benefit in impacted and underserved communities. Brownfields  As with any long-standing industrial company, GE owns many former manufacturing properties that are no longer core GE assets. These properties can be found anywhere from thriving manufacturing hubs to small towns and rural areas. GE has committed to stewarding these unused properties responsibly back to productive reuse in a way that stimulates economic growth and community development, avoids blight and redirects GE’s financial assets back to GE’s operations. For certain parcels with lengthy operating histories, this commitment can prove costly and time-consuming due to obsolete infrastructure and environmental impacts."
General Electric_2240,"Beginning in 2012, GE founded its Brownfields Program to focus  on repurposing  the company’s former industrial assets. The team  categorizes its sites for action into two groups—those properties with minimal impact that can be repurposed quickly, and those properties requiring demolition, remediation, regulatory engagement or other substantial work to promote meaningful reuse. Using these categories, the team takes strategic action and makes investments following a Brownfields pipeline to ensure that all sites move successfully through the process. GE’s Brownfields Program has advanced GE’s property stewardship  while bringing value  to GE and local communities. Since 2012, GE has  sold more than 350 properly prepared industrial sites, double GE’s pace before the program."
General Electric_2245,"Almost 70% of these sites required substantial work to allow appropriate reuse, compared to 52% pre-program. By coupling a data-driven approach to site preparation with an increased sales rate, GE Brownfields has repurposed 1.9 times more challenging sites than GE’s previous approach. Simultaneously, the team has increased average property sales values by 18%, allowing the team to recoup $1.4 billion in sales pr oceeds. This is more than 2.5 times the  sales value received over a comparable prior timeframe. Moreover, by repurposing these idle assets, GE has shifted approximately $40 million that would have been paid annually to maintain these vacant properties back into core business operations, freeing up $235 million over the life of the program."
General Electric_2250,"GE’S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE  AND FOCUS ON BROWNFIELDS  Beginning in 2019, GE enhanced its Brownfields Program to prioritize  cleanup and redevelopment of idle contaminated properties in environmental justice (EJ) communities. The White House and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have defined EJ neighborhoods as those with disadvantaged populations that are most heavily impacted by historic industrial activity and least able to bear this burden. In many EJ communities, financial investment falters and commercial opportunities lag despite property cleanup. This leaves neighborhoods with vacant buildings or empty parcels that create blight and reduce further investment. GE is committed to remediating and repurposing its contaminated  vacant proper ties in EJ communities to help establish new hubs of  economic growth that create jobs and to assist EJ communities to remove barriers that hamper realization of community benefits."
General Electric_2255,"Using EJSCREEN (developed by the U.S. EPA) and the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (released by the Council on Environmental Quality), GE reviewed its full inventory of more than 100 owned, underused properties in the U.S. to identify the 53 parcels that are located in EJ communities. Focusing on these parcels, we have worked to define those barriers that discourage reinvestment and meaningful reuse, seeking community partners to help define local needs. Local EJ community leaders have shared one of their most pressing  needs is f inancial investment to remove obsolete buildings and  infrastructure. In response, GE has committed more than $40 million to demolish its obsolete structures in EJ neighborhoods. Demolition is complete in Goldsboro, Kansas City, and St. Louis, Missouri, and is underway in Memphis, Tennessee."
General Electric_2260,"Remaining projects will continue through 2023. EJ community leaders also identified site remediation and real  estate repurposing as primar y community needs. GE has undertaken  environmental investigation and cleanup at more than 45 of its highest priority EJ properties. GE will work hand-in-hand with local governments, private groups, property experts and technical resources to define reuse plans that buttress community goals and catalyze sustainable economic development. Strategies under consideration include improved neighborhood drainage and flood relief; green energy/ electric car infrastructure; industrial repurposing; and community solar installations."
General Electric_2265,"Outside the U.S., GE is also screening its underutilized properties to  target cleanup and r edevelopment investments in disadvantaged  communities. Several potential properties were identified for action in 2021. We are now identifying community collaborators to work with GE to target cleanup and infrastructure investments that will help achieve local goals. Clean interior in North Bergen,   New Jersey. Mercury line removal and restoration in Lexington, Kentucky."
General Electric_2270,"NORTH BERGEN, NEW JERSEY   Disadvantaged community  (EJScreen)  GE acquired the 7-acre GE NY Service  Center  in 1956 to operate as the  consolidated regional electrical equipment support facility for GE and its customers. Through 2010, this location serviced electric motors, steam and gas turbine components, railroad components, switch gear and motor generators. Operations resulted in the unintended release of polychlorinated biphenyls and solvents, both inside and outside the building. Beginning in 2018, with the approval of federal and state regulators, GE cleaned and refurbished the building and remediated soil to prepare the site for future commercial or industrial reuse. GE sold the property in 2021 to a local company that distributed industrial cleaning and disinfection supplies regionally to support COVID-19 workplace safety."
General Electric_2275,"ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO   Disadv antaged community  (EJScreen)  For more than 40 years, beginning in  1967, GE Aviation  fabricated military and  commercial aircraft engine components at Former Air Force Plant 83, a 34-acre parcel in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After local officials detected solvent contamination in a city drinking water well, Plant 83 and another industrial facility were identified as potential sources. In 1983, USEPA added the site to Superfund’s National Priorities List (NPL) as the South Valley Superfund Site. In cooperation with regulators, GE demolished buildings, treated site soils and remediated groundwater impacts. In September 2019, the U.S. EPA determined that “all appropriate response actions…have been completed,” and delisted Plant 83 from the NPL."
General Electric_2280,"GE sold the North Plant area in 2021 to a local construction firm to manage building materials and is planning to sell the South Plant area in 2022. LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY  Beginning in 1946, GE constructed and  operated  the 200,000 square-foot Lexington  Lamp Plant on 17 acres in Lexington, Kentucky. The plant manufactured sealed beam automotive and specialty headlamps along with incandescent bulbs. After the plant ceased operating in August 2017, GE decommissioned equipment, thoroughly cleaned the building and voluntarily investigated site soil and groundwater conditions. GE identified elemental mercury within vacuum lines, industrial sewers and cooling water return lines as a significant concern for building reuse."
General Electric_2285,"From November 2018 through March 2019, GE removed overhead process lines and below-ground industrial sewer and cooling water lines. Soils surrounding lines were also removed if mercury was detected. These extensive cleaning efforts allowed GE to restore the building for appropriate reuse. In 2021, GE sold the facility to a regional business to expand its growing commercial property management operations. 108  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  109    Cleaning up legacy sites  We are committed to managing sites that are, or may be, impacted with  legacy contamination arising from current or former manufacturing operations with the utmost care, ensuring the health and safety of our workers, the communities in which these sites are located and the environment."
General Electric_2290,"Further, we manage our remedial actions at these sites in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable federal financial reporting and reserve requirements. In most cases, we work in collaboration with the appropriate federal, state or global environmental regulatory authorities charged with management of these sites, and also work with other key stakeholders (e.g., local municipalities, the public, etc.) to encourage dialogue and communications that can be factored into our remedial decision making. We employ a matrixed resource approach to remedial site management, utilizing a wing-to-wing team of in-house and external environmental professionals and other subject matter experts (i.e., technical, legal, finance and communications personnel) to manage the full life cycle of a remedial project, from investigation to remedy implementation, to potential maintenance and monitoring obligations. We draw upon the experience and expertise of this team of experts to develop strategies  that utilize state-of-the-art technologies and best management practices necessary to remediate and, in some cases, redevelop these sites and return them back to the local communities for productive reuse."
General Electric_2295,"From a program management perspective, we utilize lean principles to drive long-term solutions for the environment and company, in addition to helping identify process and programmatic issues requiring improvement, and helping to drive more accountability across the team. GE recognizes contaminated sites can be concerning and controversial issues for surrounding communities. GE works to develop solutions in consensus with key regulators and the public to the fullest extent possible. For a certain subset of GE-owned legacy contaminated sites (i.e., Brownfields), GE is also focused on cleaning up those sites to facilitate redevelopment and repurposing in the communities where those sites are located. Once a remedy is decided, GE aims to exceed expectations on timing of implementation and efficacy of the outcome."
General Electric_2300,"Some of our most significant projects that were designed and implemented in close collaboration with government agencies and other stakeholders are reflected below. HOUSATONIC RIVER: REMEDY DESIGN UNDERWAY  Twenty years ago, GE committed to work with the U.S. EPA, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and local communities to clean the first 2 miles of the Housatonic River, as well as to develop a process that would govern remedy selection for the Rest of River. In 2020, we reached an agreement with the EPA and local communities that makes good on our longstanding commitment to a comprehensive cleanup of the Housatonic River that protects the environment. In addition to the more than $500 million of environmental projects that we’ve completed in the Pittsfield area over the years, GE has recently pivoted towards the next phase of river cleanup following the 2020 agreement. GE is currently working to design the “Rest of River” remedy by submitting various site-wide work plans as well as reach-specific sediment, riverbank, and floodplain soils sampling plans."
General Electric_2305,"In 2022, EPA’s administrative court, the Environmental Appeals Board, upheld the 2020 agreement and the final permit became effective in March 2022.

General Electric_2315,"Following remediation, the site, which began operating in 1947, will allow beneficial redevelopment. Early facility operations generated a waste stream composed of broken glass and lighting components, some containing mercury, which was placed in selected areas of the site to fill low spots. A comprehensive environmental investigation confirmed widespread shallow soil contamination consistent with the historic production of lighting products on the property. Following approval of the Remedial Action Plan by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (EMB), National Capital Region, the demolition of all structures and the removal of contaminated materials at the Site began. Non-contaminated demolition debris is crushed for reuse on site, which reduces  110  |  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  GE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  |  111   off-site transport and minimizes the effect of the remediation on traffic in this densely populated area as much as possible."
General Electric_2320,"Wherever possible, metal building materials were segregated for recycling. Materials containing mercury and other contaminants were excavated and bagged under controlled conditions (dust and vapor suppression). Prior to disposal, contaminated material had been treated at a licensed waste management facility to immobilize contaminants. Excavation of contaminated materials began in February 2021 and is anticipated to be completed in July 2022.Human rights  People are at the heart of GE’s operations and strategy. We released our GE Human Rights Report in 2022  to provide greater transparency into  how we run our human rights program, from our suite of governance documents to our due diligence program."

These policies are embedded throughout GE’s business operations through enterprise standards and policy documents and implementation. GE has implemented operational requirements for businesses known as the Human Rights Enterprise Standard, which helps businesses  identify and understand the salient human rights risks across the company and how they are expected to respond to those risks. The Enterprise Standard sets out minimum requirements that businesses must adhere to regarding risk assessment and identification, due diligence of third parties and escalation and remediation of any concerns related to human rights."
General Electric_2345,"It provides practical guidance and best practices for business implementation to mitigate human rights risk within our operations. The Human Rights Working Group, led by our Global Human Rights Counsel, meets regularly to discuss the implementation of the standard  and the evolving landscape of human rights issues and risks in the communities we serve.

General Electric_2360,"Based on our engagement with the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment (L GRR), GE adopted and implemented the Employer Pays  Principle with respect to any recruitment fees and prohibits the types of actions associated with the most common forms of modern slavery, including the withholding of immigration documents and misleading recruitment tactics. As one of its initiatives, LGRR works with GE and member companies to create demand for responsible recruitment by raising awareness about the benefits of ethical practices and developing tools to help companies implement the Employer Pays Principle. Since 2008, GE has been an active participant in the United Nations Global C ompact aligning with the Ten Principles of the UNGC around  human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Over the years, GE partnered with the UNGC on initiatives such as the Human Rights Dilemmas for Multinational Corporations in Emerging Markets and most recently participated in its Young Sustainable Development Goals Innovators Program. Our human rights program depends on the practical understanding of our people and business partners."
General Electric_2365,"Taking a multi-faceted approach helps to address the human rights challenges GE faces in the various markets we serve and operate in. We provide employees with learning modules on human rights and forced labor; company-wide policies and programs; the causes and global footprint of forced labor; and, most importantly, how they can serve a role in identifying and reporting possible signs of human rights issues when they are at GE operations, supplier facilities or customer sites.

General Electric_2370,"Since 2002, GE has implemented an extensive supplier responsibility governance (SRG) program to build and strengthen an ethical, sustainable and transparent global supply chain and establish clear social and environmental responsibility requirements for suppliers. All suppliers must contractually commit to the GE Integrity Guide for  Suppliers, Contractors and Consultants, which requires suppliers to  strictly comply with laws, provide a safe and healthy work environment and meet GE’s standards of ethical conduct relating to human rights, the fair treatment of workers, environmental protection and resource conservation. GE explicitly prohibits suppliers from using child, prison, forced or indentured labor and subjecting workers to any form of compulsion, coercion or human trafficking. We further require that our first-tier suppliers cascade the requirements of the GE Integrity Guide to their sub-tier suppliers. Under this multi-faceted ethical supply chain program, suppliers are prioritized for detailed pre-engagement and periodic follow-up, onsite assessments based on country risks (including human trafficking risk), supplier past performance and other factors, such as media reports or supplier employee complaints."
General Electric_2375,"The SRG program uses a systematic approach for assessing risks in our supply chain, monitoring and improving supplier performance. Our approach includes:  •  A country risk assessment, updated every two years, incorporating manufacturing risk along with human rights risk assessments lifted  from third-party data and risk indices. •  Clear risk assessment criteria to prioritize suppliers for audits depending upon factors such as their location, if they are producing parts that will be incorporated into GE products and/ or if they use labor brokers to recruit migrant workers. •  A rigorous auditing program using trained and certified SRG auditors, to assess conformance with our requirements prior to onboarding. •  Monitoring the continued compliance and improvement of existing suppliers using thorough on-site audits at a typical frequency of one to five years based upon the supplier’s risk profile."
General Electric_2380,"•  Recorded, tracked and monitored, all SRG audit findings must be in our proprietary reporting tool. The supplier must rectify issues in a timely manner. We track all issues to closure, with verification of the elimination or appropriate mitigation of such risks. GE will suspend all purchase orders under the contract, should the supplier not mitigate or eliminate issues as required by the corrective action plan. •  Continual evaluation of new methods to assess and manage risk in our supply chain and effectively address the evolving challenges and risks."
General Electric_2385,"For example, following the pandemic restrictions in 2020 and 2021, GE allowed the option of desktop remote audits for suppliers so our auditing program could continue. Applying the same scope and questionnaire used in the on-site audits, our remote audits relied on digital tools to allow suppliers to provide supporting documentation and to verify the closure of audit findings. GE continues exploring options to improve our virtual auditing capabilities performed internally and externally. AUDITING GE’S GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN  Our goal is to work with suppliers to bring them into compliance and drive sustainable improvements in their operations and practices. However, in the event of a serious violation of law, human rights or GE’s code of conduct, GE will act to immediately cease the business relationship."
General Electric_2390,"The SRG program drives GE’s ability to continuously assess, monitor and drive improvement in its supply chain. More importantly, through our regular communication and engagement with our suppliers, we can build their capability to improve their compliance, environment, health and safety practices and respectful workplace practices and reduce human rights and modern slavery risks. RESPONSIBLE MINERAL SOURCING  Aligned with GE’s SRG program, GE strives to assure our supply chains are ethical and sustainable when obtaining products containing tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold (known collectively as “3TG”), cobalt and mica, which are common constituents of many of our products from aircraft engines to wind turbines. GE is committed to working to eliminate from our products all “conflict minerals” that potentially finance armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), its adjoining countries or other conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). GE’s Responsible  Mineral Sourcing Principles outline GE’s commitment to respecting  human rights through responsible sourcing practices when it comes to sourcing products containing these minerals."
General Electric_2395,"GE prohibits use of forced or child labor in its operations and supply chain and proactively addresses these concerns through its  Ethical  Supply Chain Program . We recognize conflict is just one of the risks  related to mineral sourcing where critical issues such as poverty,  environmental degradation, child labor and general inequality must be addressed as well. Each year, we undertake reasonable due diligence to determine if any of our products containing 3TG originated in the DRC or other CAHRAs. We then file a report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the use of 3TG in our products and the outcome of our 3TG sourcing due diligence.

ConocoPhillips concluded 2021 with an enhanced portfolio  after completing two transformative acquisitions. We  successfully integrated Concho Resources and Shell’s  Permian assets into the business, while navigating one of the  most challenging eras in industry history, one marked by a  global pandemic and accompanying economic and energy  demand downturns."
Conoco Phillips_5,"As the world economy recovered, we  continued operating safely, addressed our SD priorities and  advanced our climate risk plans and actions. This performance demonstrated that our business model  – focused on peer-leading distributions, balance sheet  strength, disciplined investment and ESG leadership –  positions us to adapt and compete across business cycles,  geopolitical events and the evolving energy transition. Meeting the central aim of the Paris Agreement to respond  to the climate challenge is a worldwide imperative for which  governments and companies alike have adopted net-zero  ambitions. We intend to play a meaningful role in this vital  effort by fulfilling our Triple Mandate to responsibly meet  energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive  returns on and of capital and achieve our net-zero  operational emissions ambition. This mandate represents  our commitment to create long-term value while enhancing  climate protection and accelerating our contribution to the  energy transition."
Conoco Phillips_10,"A Message from our  Chairman and CEO We’ve developed and published a detailed Plan for the Net-Zero  Energy Transition  that describes how we will manage the  transition’s associated risks and emerging opportunities. Under  this plan, we intensified our efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and 2  emissions, with an ambition to become net-zero by 2050. Steps taken include:  ŰIncreasing our previously announced operational GHG  emissions intensity reduction target from 35-45% to  40-50% by 2030 on a gross operated basis. ŰBroadening this goal to include non-operated net equity  investments. ŰSetting a further 10% reduction target for methane  emissions intensity by 2025 from our 2019 baseline,  building on the 65% reduction achieved since 2015."
Conoco Phillips_15,"ŰAiming for zero routine flaring by 2025, five years earlier  than the World Bank’s goal. ŰAdvocating for a U.S. carbon price that would directly  reduce consumer energy demand and thus end-use  (Scope 3) emissions. ŰExpanding our scenario planning to include multiple  alternative energy transition pathways that test our  strategy’s resilience to climate-related risk. ŰIncorporating into our capital allocation process a fully  burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon. ŰRefocusing our portfolio on assets with the low cost of  supply and low emissions intensity that will be essential  in meeting energy transition pathway demand."
Conoco Phillips_20,"Our vital role in the energy transition will also include  capturing potential business value through a recently formed  Low Carbon Technologies organization. This team is tasked  with developing a companywide Net-Zero Roadmap for  Scope 1 and 2 emissions, understanding the new energies  landscape and prioritizing possible future investments in low  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 2Chairman and CEO MessageRyan Lance   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer June 2022carbon energy solutions.

Our water  management achievements included using more than  54% recycled produced water as source water in the  Permian Basin and reducing freshwater withdrawals by  25% at APLNG in Australia."
Conoco Phillips_25,"Our biodiversity management  efforts in our Lower 48 business unit included  maintaining voluntary conservation agreements on  more than 500,000 acres in New Mexico, Oklahoma and  Texas, and the creation of a biodiversity mapping tool to  inform stakeholders of our development strategies. We  strengthened community relationships, and enhanced  community sustainability by utilizing local service and  supply providers. Our ESG leadership efforts include constructive,  meaningful dialogue that enhances our understanding  of stakeholder priorities and concerns and enables us  to collaboratively address them. ConocoPhillips remains  committed to engaging with our stakeholders as  expectations rise and challenges continue. We intend  to meet our SD priorities and respond effectively to  evolving risks and opportunities that arise throughout  the energy transition."
Conoco Phillips_30,"ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 3Chairman and CEO MessageThrough our diverse range of roles, skills and experiences,  the members of the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors have  ongoing exposure to current sustainability matters that are  most important to the company’s shareholders and other  stakeholders. These environmental, social and governance  (ESG) topics continually evolve, and there is increasing  shareholder interest in how the company performs in  these areas as related to its expected long-term value. This  includes growing scrutiny of how the company is addressing  transition risk and opportunity and supporting solutions that  contribute to the world’s desire to achieve net-zero by 2050. As part of our oversight responsibilities, the Board  engages extensively with management on all sustainable  development (SD) issues, including management of  climate-related risks. Sustainability targets, plans and  performance are reviewed during regularly scheduled  Board and Committee meetings throughout the year  and at our annual Board strategy session."
Conoco Phillips_35,"This robust and  ongoing engagement by the full Board and its committees  ensures strong oversight of the company’s sustainability  commitments, actions and results. Executives and other key leaders provide regular, in-depth  briefings to the Board’s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee (PPSC) covering key sustainability issues as  we work to identify, evaluate and monitor ESG trends and  risks that could affect business activities and performance. We also engage with stakeholders, including shareholders,  to understand their expectations of performance and  accountability. Areas of discussion during 2021 included  climate-risk strategy implementation, nature-based  carbon offsets, the company’s energy transition plan,  low-carbon technologies, new opportunities in carbon  capture and storage and hydrogen, biodiversity, just  transition, ESG trends in the financial sector, external  engagement, government policy, and review of SD  strategic priorities. Additionally, the Board Audit and Finance Committee  (AFC) receives annual updates on enterprise risk  management (ERM) and cybersecurity risks."

We have been on a journey to integrate sustainability into  planning and decision making for decades. Before our first  sustainable development (SD) report was published in 2005,  we had implemented a process to identify and manage  environmental and social issues and assess performance. That  process has evolved over the years as the risk and opportunity  trends in science, demographics, technology and policy have  changed. We published our first sustainable development and  climate change positions in 2003."
Conoco Phillips_55,"Since that time, we have  updated those positions and developed positions on water,  biodiversity, human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion  (DE&I). We also continue to refine our governance structure to  manage sustainability risks and opportunities throughout the  organization. Our systems-based approach, by design, includes  continuous improvement and internal assurance.We have long played a meaningful role in a vital industry, and believe that we have an important  role to play in the energy transition by executing on three objectives: reliably and responsibly deliver  oil and gas production to meet transition pathway demand; deliver competitive returns on and of  capital for our stockholders; and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambition.

Our  integrated management system approach to identifying,  assessing and managing sustainable development (SD) risks  is aligned with how we make business decisions to ensure  the consistent global identification and assessment of risks. This system links directly to the ERM process, which includes  an annual risk review by executive leadership and the Board. These elements help us manage and mitigate risk, as well as  track our SD performance. Assessing and Managing Risks Our SD Risk Management Standard mandates a process for  operated assets and projects to assess and manage risks  to ensure corporate oversight, assurance and consistent  implementation."
Conoco Phillips_135,"Risks are identified and assessed against  the physical, social and political settings of our operations  by subject matter experts in each business unit (BU)  and project. Local concerns may influence the potential  importance of these environmental and social matters,  including cumulative effects. Each risk is then assessed using a matrix that evaluates both its likelihood and consequence. In evaluating the consequence severity, we consider potential  impacts on employee and public safety, sociocultural and  economic impacts to stakeholders, environmental impacts,  and reputational and financial implications. Risks identified as  significant or high at the corporate or BU level are included  in the corporate SD Risk Register."
Conoco Phillips_140,"The company undertakes a  review of SD risks annually and updates the SD Risk Register  and associated action plans. An audit protocol for the standard  was developed in 2020 and we implemented a regular audit  schedule in 2021. The standard further mandates developing action plans for  mitigated risks ranked significant or high and are tracked in  the corporate SD Risk Register. Risks that are no longer ranked  significant or high due to the effectiveness of mitigation  actions, as well as risks that are identified as medium or low,  continue to be tracked at the Business Unit level.

These plans include  details about our commitments, related responsibilities  and milestones. As part of annual updates to the register,  the action plans and their effectiveness are evaluated, and  decisions are made to continue mitigation measures, add new  measures or simply monitor the risk for further developments."
Conoco Phillips_150,"Significant and high risks are removed from the corporate  risk register when mitigation actions have reduced the level  of risk, and they are tracked to ensure ongoing mitigation  effectiveness. The SD Risk Register and action plans are also  used to track performance and guide goal setting. Read more   about Performance and Compensation on our website. Action plans for prioritized risks are typically managed  at the BU level, along with the ongoing management of  SD performance and engagement designed to minimize  or avoid other social and environmental aspects of our  business. Overarching risk management actions, such as  greenhouse gas (GHG) target setting, prioritization of global  emissions-abatement projects and disclosure and reporting,  are managed at the corporate level."

Our Long- Range Plan (LRP) forecasts key data for our corporate  strategy covering our proposed portfolio development and  performance, production, costs and cash flows. We also  use the LRP to forecast GHG emissions and water use to  understand our future environmental footprint. Environmental  and social risk mitigations, such as emissions reduction  projects, are reflected in the LRP and our annual budget."
Conoco Phillips_165,"Our corporate strategy defines the company’s direction for  exploration and development, including portfolio, capital  allocation and cost structure. Our cost of supply, portfolio  diversification (both geological and geographical) and  technology investments are aspects of the corporate strategy  that also address sustainability risk. For example, a low cost  of supply mitigates climate transition risk in lower-energy  demand scenarios. Having a geographically diverse portfolio  helps mitigate the risk of community or stakeholder concerns  delaying a significant portion of our production. Investing in  water treatment technology allows us to recycle produced  water and decrease our reliance on local water sources."
Conoco Phillips_170,"We  work with company leadership through our governance  structure, ERM system and energy transition models to ensure  our strategy effectively manages SD risks. Key SD Management Processes Our integrated management system is based on mandatory  and auditable corporate standards, which are supported by  principles and guidelines aligned with how we make business  decisions to ensure the consistent global identification and  assessment of SD risks. This includes integration into key  business-planning processes for the company, from business  development activities and exploration to developing major  capital projects and managing our day-to-day operations. We perform due diligence on acquisitions, divestitures, trades,  exchanges and farm-in/farm-out agreements.

While the majority of ConocoPhillips’ oil and natural gas  reserves and production are within Organization of Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations, some of the  world’s most resource-rich areas are in countries that pose  risks associated with political instability, inadequate rule of law  or corruption. Before entering a new country – or for other  new developments, when warranted by the geopolitical  environment – we have adopted comprehensive risk  management tools to evaluate and manage these types of  risks. A preliminary due diligence assessment is conducted to  identify significant risks, including social, environmental and  political concerns, and define how they will be managed. As operated and non-operated projects are developed and  put forward for internal approval, consideration is given  to environmental and social risks and their mitigation."

Led by  our chief compliance officer, our Global Compliance and  Ethics team ensures adherence with applicable laws and  the highest ethical standards, promotes a positive corporate  reputation, reduces criminal and civil liability, and sets the  tone for an ethical work environment. The team includes  local ambassadors embedded in business units and functions  who help support and administer our Global Compliance and  Ethics program. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement,  we updated our investigation model in 2021 to include  enhancements to our investigative processes and expanded  engagement with our business units and functions."
Conoco Phillips_205,"We aimed  to improve efficiency of the management process and to  increase the agility of our investigative services. Aspects of our compliance and ethics program relevant to  financial reporting are annually reviewed by the company’s  external auditor, and global compliance and ethics processes  are periodically audited by our internal audit function and  external compliance experts. Code of Business Ethics and Conduct Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct  is the foundation  of our compliance and ethics program, explaining our  responsibilities and providing guidance for behaviors. It covers  a range of topics including business ethics, competition law,  anti-corruption, gifts and entertainment, conflicts of interest  and political involvement. In 2021, we reviewed our current  code."
Conoco Phillips_210,"Using data from risk assessments and cultural gap  analysis, we updated and added topics to our code. All new employees receive training on the Code as part of  their new hire training curriculum. Current employees have  access to web-based training on the Code at any time and are  periodically required to repeat this training. Employees who  are most exposed to legal risks, such as corruption, take part in web-based training and other targeted training. Employees  may also receive training on competition law, anti-boycott,  economic sanctions, export controls, insider trading and  political activities."
Conoco Phillips_215,"We annually require employees to certify  they have read the Code, made all required disclosures and  reported all potential concerns. With exceptions for certain  types of leave, 100% of employees completed this certification  in 2021. Systems and Practices for   Reporting Violations We encourage employees and contractors to ask questions  and seek guidance about compliance and ethics matters  and we give them tools to guide ethical decision-making. Employees also understand they have a responsibility to report  actual or suspected misconduct. We have several confidential  reporting mechanisms."
Conoco Phillips_220,"They may speak to a trusted manager,  supervisor, human resources representative or Global  Compliance and Ethics representative. Additionally, there is  an anonymous option. Any stakeholder, whether employee,  contractor, shareholder or the general public may report  an actual or suspected violation of the Code anonymously  through our 24-hour Ethics Helpline . The helpline is hosted by  a third party to ensure anonymity and is available worldwide  via the web or phone in multiple languages. ConocoPhillips  prohibits retaliation of any kind against employees for raising  an ethical or legal concern."
Conoco Phillips_225,"In 2021, Global Compliance and Ethics received questions,  concerns and requests for advice from employees and  stakeholders across our businesses. As part of our updated  investigation model, we investigated workplace conduct,  conflicts of interest, financial and business integrity matters,  misuse of company assets and other allegations. Remedial  and disciplinary actions were taken whenever appropriate. Depending on the scale and type of concern, issues were  elevated to provide appropriate management oversight. Senior  management and the Audit and Finance Committee of the  Board were also provided regular updates on our program, so  they could ensure that the program promotes ConocoPhillips’  SPIRIT Values , addresses the compliance and ethics risks in our  business and works effectively."

We are committed  to upholding our business ethics by supporting business  opportunities and capacity building for local and diverse  suppliers in our own operations through our supply chain. Supplier Engagement  As we integrate sustainable development into our key business  activities, suppliers play a significant role. From constructing  our facilities to managing our work camps, providing well  services and supplying equipment, how they manage their  impact on the environment and community is important to us  and affects our performance."
Conoco Phillips_235,"We regularly engage our suppliers through business reviews  and supplier audits to:   ŰIdentify sustainable development opportunities and risks  in the supply chains of critical categories. ŰStandardize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to  ensure alignment with our Environmental, Social and  Governance (ESG) performance objectives. ŰTrack metrics, review performance, and identify  continuous improvement opportunities. ŰShare best practices for building supplier capacity  throughout the supply chain. Another important element of our ongoing engagement  with key suppliers is our annual Supplier Sustainability Forum."
Conoco Phillips_240,"In 2021, we hosted a virtual forum with 120 participants  including suppliers from more than 50 companies and  ConocoPhillips representatives from across the globe. The agenda was designed to communicate our strategic  sustainability objectives and collaborate with suppliers to  manage and mitigate the environmental and social impacts  from activities and operations throughout the supply chain. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 17 Integrating Sustainability Supply Chain SustainabilityTopics discussed included our net-zero ambition and Triple  Mandate, an introduction to our Low Carbon Technologies  organization, and an overview of technologies deployed  to help reduce environmental impacts and improve  sustainability. Mitigating supplier risk is critical to support our operations  through sustainable procurement. Driven by supplier stability  concerns, we began monitoring the financial health of  suppliers in 2016 through quarterly assessments."
Conoco Phillips_245,"Additionally,  supply chain leaders meet  quarterly to proactively  assess risk for over 150  business-critical suppliers. This supports continuity  of global operations  through the development  of risk mitigation plans to  cover supply or service  interruptions. In 2021,  we interacted with  suppliers regularly to avert  bottlenecks, strengthen ties, seek out emissions reduction  opportunities, and address risk mitigations due to global  supply chain disruptions and the lingering effects of the  COVID-19 pandemic. As the oil services sector went through  further consolidation and more suppliers showed ongoing  signs of financial distress, we further utilized products and  services from local suppliers to support our operations. This approach continues to help maintain continuity of our  operations and improve our local community engagement."
Conoco Phillips_250,"In Canada, as the markets tightened and vaccine mandates  were implemented, we broadened our supplier base for  both materials and services but consistently started with  local and First Nation companies. During sourcing events,  we also conducted comprehensive contract risk classification  assessments to quantify inherent risks and establish mitigation strategies prior to contract award. This process has been used  across our Supply Chain organization globally for over 15 years. Engaging our suppliers to identify and manage risks allows us  to mutually improve our sustainability performance. Supplier Recognition  Suppliers who positively impact our business are honored  by our annual Supplier Recognition Awards."
Conoco Phillips_255,"Sustainability is  an integral consideration for these supplier awards. In 2021,  awards ranged from gas capture solutions to environmental  planning.

We also place a high priority on purchasing goods and  services locally and are committed to giving local contractors  and suppliers the opportunity to participate in projects and  operating requirements, generally through a competitive  bidding process. We also seek opportunities to develop local  suppliers and promote local hiring as appropriate to meet  business needs.

Conoco Phillips_275,"Supplier Diversity  We expect to do business with qualified suppliers that share  our values, whether minority, woman, disabled, LGBTQ+, or  veteran-owned, small business enterprises, or global, local  and Indigenous suppliers around the world. In the U.S., we  do business with diverse companies and continue to provide  access to business opportunities through our Supplier  Diversity Program. This approach attracts qualified suppliers,  stimulates local economic development, and creates long- lasting social and economic benefits in our stakeholder  communities. In the U.S., our 2021 Supplier Diversity Program  totaled $533 million spent with businesses owned by veterans,  minorities, women, members of the LGBTQ+ community,  service-disabled people and historically underutilized  businesses (HUBs). Additionally, ConocoPhillips recorded  $905 million in expenditures with small businesses."
Conoco Phillips_280,"Through our Supplier Diversity program, we actively participate in  certifying and developing diverse, small and local businesses  in the United States. In 2021, we conducted one in-person and 16 virtual supplier  diversity events aimed at local supplier capacity-building  efforts. This helped to increase our spending with local  suppliers in 2021.

Stakeholders can also create customized reports, based on  topics of interest, by using our report builder . Issue Prioritization  We evolve and refresh our perspective on sustainability  reporting by considering the most pressing issues affecting  our stakeholders, the global community and our industry."
Conoco Phillips_295,"We determine the most relevant issues for our reporting by  engaging with internal and external stakeholders throughout  the year to better understand concerns about our business,  particularly relating to the environment, society and our  governance. Identification  Through our annual risk assessment process, each business  unit identifies potential sustainability risks while considering  the physical, social and political settings of our operations. Local concerns may influence the potential importance of  these environmental and social matters, including cumulative  effects. Each risk is assessed using a matrix that evaluates both  its likelihood and consequence. In evaluating the consequence  level, we consider potential impacts to stakeholders and the  company."
Conoco Phillips_300,"Our Issues Working Groups (IWG), comprised of  internal subject matter experts for climate change, water,  stakeholder engagement/human rights and biodiversity,  meet quarterly to discuss issues in each subject area. Annual  discussions with other key internal functions provide further  input and prioritization of the topic list. Through meetings, correspondence and a review of publicly  available materials, we gather opinions and input from key  external stakeholders to further identify issues and potential  impacts. These include mainstream investors, ESG-focused  investors, banks, rating agencies and ESG-focused nonprofit  organizations, as well as community members, leaders, policy  makers and regulators in the areas where we operate. This is  supplemented with analysis of the topics being considered  by rating agencies and other survey questions as well as  recommended reporting for the Sustainability Accounting  Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) and the World Economic Forum: Measuring  Stakeholder Capitalism."
Conoco Phillips_305,"We also review the priority issues as  publicly reported by industry peers to ensure alignment with  identified industry issues. Prioritization  We develop a list of potentially important issues across  a range of topics from governance to safety to impacts  on the environment and society. In 2021, we conducted  a priority issues assessment to help identify and prioritize  the reporting topics about our business as it relates to ESG. Participants included subject matter experts from over 20 of  our key functions within the company who provided further  insight and prioritized topics based on level of interest or  concern to key stakeholders and strategic importance to the  company. This process helped determine the significance of  18 sustainability topics."
Conoco Phillips_310,"The ESG issues covered in this report  reflect discussions with subject matter experts from across our  company, findings from primary and secondary research, the  feedback we received, and insights we gained through our  ongoing engagement with stakeholders.

ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 29 Climate Governance FrameworkStrategy  Our objective is to manage climate-related risk, optimize  opportunities and equip the company to respond to  evolving investor sentiment around the world, technologies  for emissions reduction and alternative energy technologies  and uncertainties such as government policies. The continually evolving energy transition requires a strategy  that will remain robust across a range of potential future  outcomes."
Conoco Phillips_445,"Our strategy is comprised of four pillars:  ŰTargets : Our framework consists of a hierarchy of  targets – from a long-term ambition that sets the  direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term  performance target for GHG emissions intensity, to  near-term targets for flaring and methane intensity  reductions. ŰTechnology choices:  We continue to expand our  emissions reduction programs at existing operations,  while also evaluating opportunities and technologies  that can closely integrate with our global operations,  markets and competencies. ŰPortfolio choices:  We are integrating climate-related  risk into our portfolio decision making through  consideration of carbon pricing and stranded assets,  as well as low cost-of-supply and low GHG-intensity  resources. ŰExternal engagement: Our stakeholders’ points  of view inform the evolution of our climate-related  frameworks, metrics, actions and public policy. Progress in these four pillars is demonstrated throughout the  following sections."
Conoco Phillips_450,"Across those pillars, our strategy takes into  consideration results from scenario planning, near-, medium-,  and long-term risks, and ways to address impacts from those  risks. An important component of our strategy is the new  Plan  for the Net-Zero Energy Transition , first published in the 2022  Proxy Statement and expanded further in this section. Energy Outlook In its 2021 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy  Agency  (IEA) illustrated the following four different energy mix  scenarios reflecting changes in total energy demand in 2050 as  compared to 2020:  ŰStated Policies:  Total primary energy demand increases  by over 26%. ŰAnnounced Pledges:  Total energy demand increases by  over 14%. ŰSustainable Development: Total energy demand  declines by around 2%."
Conoco Phillips_455,"ŰNet-Zero Emissions:  Total energy demand declines by  almost 8%. Demand for natural gas and oil has different outcomes across  the IEA scenarios. Demand grows compared to 2020 in the  Announced Pledges scenario but declines in the Sustainable  Development and Net-Zero Emissions Scenarios. Even in the Net-Zero Scenario, 2050 oil demand remains at  19 MMBBL/day and natural gas at 27 MMBOE/day and, despite  a reallocation of capital to renewables, significant investment  “We pride ourselves on our commitment to ESG excellence  and leadership. ConocoPhillips will continue to do our part  as we fulfill our Triple Mandate of reliably and responsibly  meeting energy transition demand, delivering competitive  returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero ambition."
Conoco Phillips_460,"This represents our commitment to create long-term value  while enhancing climate protection and accelerating our  contribution to the energy transition.” — RYAN LANCE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 30 Strategy Climate in upstream natural gas and oil is still required. IEA estimates  this to average $495 billion each year from 2020 to 2050  globally in the Announced Pledges scenario and $210 billion  per year from 2020 to 2050 in the Net-Zero Emissions Scenario,  a total of approximately $14.8 trillion globally and $6.3 trillion  respectively for the period 2020 to 2050. Achieving the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario  (limiting temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius)  requires significant progress on several fronts:  ŰImproving energy efficiency of power generation,  transportation and industrial processes. ŰReducing emissions from fossil fuels or capturing and  storing or utilizing those emissions. ŰIncreasing the amount of non-carbon energy, such as  renewables and nuclear power."

Increasing renewable power utilization would  also require significant improvement in the daily and seasonal  reliability of wind- and solar-powered electricity generation,  or a significant improvement in energy storage that would  reduce the amount of backup fossil fuel-fired electricity  generation needed. The Net-Zero Emissions Scenario is useful data to inform  the decisions to be made by policy makers, who have the  greatest scope to move the world closer to its climate goals. The assumptions used in the scenario are challenging."
Conoco Phillips_470,"For  example, as previously mentioned, reducing energy demand  by almost 8% from 2020 levels, effectively requires reverting  energy demand back to 2010 levels, while supporting  3 billion more people with three times the economic activity. Increasing renewables’ share of the electricity supply to  the level assumed in 2050 would require annual capacity  additions four times the record that was set in 2020. The  electricity market in 2050 is assumed to be 150% greater than  the market in 2020, the equivalent of adding an electricity  market the size of India every year. Further, of 400 milestones  needed to achieve net-zero emissions described in the  Net-Zero Emissions Scenario, 85% are demand-side actions  requiring government intervention. It will continue to be  important for policymakers to address the imperatives of  energy security and affordability alongside climate risk."
Conoco Phillips_475,"These widely varying factors are the reason scenario planning  is important. There is not just one pathway to a low carbon  future; there are numerous ways in which government action  and technology development could interact with consumer  behavior to bring about a low-carbon future. Performance on  climate-related risk and opportunity is driven by the strength  of strategic planning, including the use of widely varying  scenarios, as well as the financial strength and asset flexibility  to manage across a range of possibilities. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 31 Strategy Climate Scenario Planning at  ConocoPhillips  The scenarios we have developed describe possible pathways  leading to a particular outcome. Scenarios are hypothetical  constructs and are not meant to be used as predictions of  what is likely or forecasts of what we think is going to happen;  they should be used to illustrate what factors drive future  developments."
Conoco Phillips_480,"We use scenarios in our strategic planning  process to:  ŰGain better understanding of external factors that  impact our business to assist in the identification of  major risks and opportunities and inform mitigating  actions. ŰIdentify leading indicators and trends. ŰTest the robustness of our strategy across different  business environments. ŰCommunicate risks appropriately. ŰInform how we position our business, as technologies  and markets evolve, to capitalize on opportunities that  meet risk and return criteria."
Conoco Phillips_485,"Using scenarios enables us to understand a range of risks  around potential commodity market prices associated  with various GHG reduction scenarios. To assist our capital  allocation decisions, we can test our current portfolio of assets  and investment opportunities against these future possibilities  and identify where strengths and weaknesses may exist. We rarely make any decision based on a single source of  information, but use a range of analyses, input and information  when developing our strategy. The detail of our scenarios gives  insight into the analysis we use to inform our strategic decision  making and reinforces to stakeholders and shareholders  that we are both preparing for reductions in GHG consistent  with the Paris Climate Agreement and developing resilient  strategies that reflect the complex and uncertain range of  energy futures. We use four main energy transition scenarios in our global  energy model: Current Trends, Moderate Transition, Accelerated  Transition and Paris Agreement."
Conoco Phillips_490,"The four scenarios incorporate a wide range of possible outcomes for energy and carbon  emissions. Technology development (both complementary  and competing), government policy (focused on both the  supply and demand side) and social choices play leading roles  in influencing the outcomes in each case. Regional differences  were included to reflect areas of the world that may take a  different pace or direction. While these scenarios extend to  2050, well beyond our operational planning period, they give  insights on trends that could have an implication for near- and  medium-term decisions and enable choices on the creation or  preservation of future options. Each scenario models the full energy system including oil,  natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear, as well as their related GHG  emissions and pricing policies."
Conoco Phillips_495,"In 2021, near-term adjustments  were made to account for actuals, and the modeled energy  system has been expanded to include hydrogen and carbon  capture, as both technologies appear vital to the energy  system. Each of these plausible pathways is designed to stretch  our thinking about potential rates of new technology adoption,  policy development and consumer behavior. The scenarios describe four pathways out of the myriad  that are possible, given the uncertainty surrounding the  development of future energy markets out to 2050. They do  not intend to describe all possible future outcomes and are  not used as a reliable indicator of the actual impact of climate  change on ConocoPhillips’ portfolio or business. In addition to using the four scenarios to analyze potential  outcomes, we regularly monitor key signposts as we work  to track the pace and direction of the energy transition and  identify potential leading indicators of change in the demand  for hydrocarbons."
Conoco Phillips_500,"In this way we aim to establish not just  which scenario we are moving toward, but also to identify  emerging disruptive scenarios. This analysis is presented to  executive management and the Board of Directors to assist in  strategic decision making. The thoughtful application of scenarios in strategic planning  is core to our ability to navigate future uncertainty and is a  practical way of conveying this information in a decision- useful manner. The key to scenario planning is the use of  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 32 Strategy Climate a wide-enough range to characterize uncertainty, rather  than trying to correctly guess specific future variables or  parameters. Different low-carbon scenarios that depict a wide  range of future possibilities help facilitate strategic planning,  but are not designed for, or intended to be used as reference  scenarios to compare companies."
Conoco Phillips_505,"For example, addressing  market price uncertainty has led us to significantly change  our portfolio, capital flexibility and cost structure over a  short period of time. This illustrates how misleading it can be  to compare companies based on a static view of a current  portfolio; a range of scenarios are possible. Scenario Descriptions Energy Intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – The  outcome for global energy-related CO₂ emissions from our  four scenarios is shown in the chart below. The scenarios  reflect differing economic activity, technology developments,  public policy developments and consumer choices, but in  all of our four scenarios, GDP becomes less energy intense  as the global economy requires less incremental energy- intensive manufacturing and industrial activity relative to service-oriented activity. “Current Trends” corresponds to  an average rate of decline in energy intensity of GDP from  2021 to 2050 of 1.5%, a rate in line with the 2010–2019 era."
Conoco Phillips_510,"Alternatively, the Paris Agreement case corresponds to  an average rate of decline in energy intensity of 3.0%. For  reference, IEA’s Net-Zero pathway corresponds to an annual  rate of 3.3% during 2021 to 2050. CURRENT TRENDS SCENARIO This scenario is built on the assumption that current trends  (2010–2019) in energy production and consumption continue. Government policies for carbon emissions remain globally  uncoordinated. Technologies evolve at a gradual pace and  current modes of transportation and power generation  remain the lowest cost, most efficient avenues for energy  consumption and generation."
Conoco Phillips_515,"Carbon taxes are introduced at a  moderate rate in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) countries, rising to only $30/tonne of  CO₂ equivalent (TeCO₂e) in 2050. It is assumed that non-OECD  countries have not implemented carbon pricing  by 2050 in this  scenario. 2 Consequently, fossil fuels continue to deliver roughly  80% of global energy needs in 2050, and energy related  carbon emissions continue to increase. The global oil market grows by 20% over 2019’s 100 MMB/D  level, driven by solid economic growth and a lack of  competitive alternatives. Transportation’s share of total oil  demand expands from ~60% (2021) to 65% in 2050."
Conoco Phillips_520,"The  automotive sector continues to evolve gradually, and the  global share of electric vehicle sales increases from 1–2%  today to 20% in 2050. The global average internal combustion  engine efficiency modestly improves by around 15%, and  petroleum remains the most prevalent fuel for all modes of  transportation. Production from all regions and resource types  are developed. The natural gas market expands at a faster rate than oil over the  long term. By 2050, natural gas demand is ~75% larger (2021),  reaching just under 700 billion cubic feet per day (BCF/D) as  growing economies utilize natural gas in all sectors."
Conoco Phillips_525,"The volume  of natural gas consumed in power generation more than  doubles by 2050. The focal point of demand shifts away from  North America and Europe toward Asia and the Middle East.

Conoco Phillips_530,"2 All carbon taxes are in 2021 dollars. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 33 Strategy Climate MODERATE TRANSITION SCENARIO This scenario assumes moderate advances in carbon pricing  policies and alternative energy technologies, with incremental  shifts in consumer preferences for low carbon products. Fossil  fuels remain at roughly 75% of the primary energy mix in 2050. Carbon taxes go into effect across OECD countries during the  mid-2020s and are $25/TeCO₂e in 2030, rising to $60 in 2050. It is assumed that China implements its proposed national  carbon pricing policy at 50% of the OECD carbon fee and that  no other non-OECD countries implement a carbon pricing  policy prior to 2050."
Conoco Phillips_535,"Global energy-related carbon emissions  stabilize by 2050. Global oil demand plateaus in the late 2030’s at around  1 10 MMB/D and then declines very slowly. Average internal  combustion engine efficiency improves by one-third. Electric  vehicle penetration is slow in the early years but accelerates  in the 2030s and 2040s, reaching 30% of the passenger auto  fleet in 2050 (compared to 0.7% in 2020). Regional policies also  influence the outcome for electrification in transportation."
Conoco Phillips_540,"Global oil production benefits from technology advances  which improve productivity and enable global demand to be  satisfied. U.S. crude oil production grows through 2030 then  falls as incremental productivity improvements slow and high- quality acreage is exhausted. Russia and OPEC grow to take a  larger share of global supply which increases geopolitical risk  to supply. The global gas market expands by 50% from 2019 levels,  by 2050. The primary driver for natural gas demand growth  is power generation."
Conoco Phillips_545,"Natural gas consumed in power  generation increases from 140 BCF/D in 2018 to 240 in 2050. Improvements in energy storage enable wind and solar to be  available throughout the day, increasing their contribution  to power generation. As in the Current Trends scenario,  global demand shifts east to Asia and the Middle East. Global  supplies remain heavily weighted to North America. U.S. shale  gas and Permian associated gas drive North American growth  until the 2030s, after which Canada leads North America’s  production growth."
Conoco Phillips_550,"In this scenario, hydrogen and Carbon Capture Utilization  and Storage (CCUS) move to become viable, standalone  business lines. Moderate progression toward national net-zero  targets increases availability of capital funding which paves the way for these technologies to take hold. CCUS grows to  1.7 gigatonnes captured in 2050, while the total hydrogen  market expands to 250 million metric tons in 2050. ACCELERATED TRANSITION SCENARIO This is a scenario with more aggressive changes in  technologies, consumer preferences and government policies  relative to Moderate Transition. Technology is vital to limiting  growth in energy demand, as the global population and  economy expand."
Conoco Phillips_555,"Social trends that are prevalent today in  specific regions or municipalities spread because technological  advances make these choices universally economic. For  example, individual auto ownership gives way to shared  mobility. Mass transit and ride-sharing are accessible and cost  effective for more people in more regions. Consumers shift  purchases toward products and services that are viewed as  environmentally responsible, and society demands more  transparent environmental stewardship from the businesses  they patronize. Governments target aggressive policies toward  GHG emissions, fossil fuel production and consumption."
Conoco Phillips_560,"Carbon  pricing goes into effect across OECD countries during the  mid-2020s and is $30 per TeCO₂e in 2030, rising to $80 in 2050. Again, China implements its proposed carbon pricing policy at  50% of the OECD price. Other non-OECD countries impose a  very low $5 per TeCO₂e price by 2030.Fossil Fuels 54%Fossil Fuels 76%Fossil Fuels 81% Fossil Fuels 79%  CONOCOPHILLIPS GLOBAL ENERGY MODEL SCENARIOS Actuals 2020 Moderate Transition 2050Accelerated Transition 2050Paris Agreement 2050MMBOED OIL NATURAL GAS COAL NUCLEAR TRADITIONAL BIOMASS RENEWABLES0100200300400500 ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 34 Strategy Climate Global oil markets reach a peak by 2028 and remain near that  level until tapering more quickly after 2035. The combination  of internal combustion engine efficiencies and faster adoption  of electric vehicles, which reach a 40% share of the passenger  vehicle fleet by 2050, reduces oil demand in the transportation  sector. Oil demand from the industrial sector grows for plastics  and chemicals."
Conoco Phillips_565,"The global natural gas market grows by 25% from 2019 to 2050. Natural gas remains a prominent fuel in electricity generation  but starts to yield market share to wind and solar in the  latter years of the scenario. By the late 2040s, energy storage  technology allows renewables to contribute a larger share of  power generation. North America’s gas production remains  fairly flat, plateauing in about 2040 before declining. Faster progression toward net-zero targets and higher carbon  prices increase capital available to new technologies, but  hydrogen and CCUS remain the frontrunners."
Conoco Phillips_570,"Captured  carbon increases to 2.7 gigatonnes by 2050, and advances  in renewables-powered hydrogen technology expand the  hydrogen market to around 300 million metric tons. PARIS AGREEMENT SCENARIO This scenario assumes technology breakthroughs, major  social movements to reduce fossil fuel consumption and  rapid global policy coordination to price GHG emissions at  a level that materially reduces fossil fuel use and emissions. It also assumes that OECD countries and China implement a  pricing3 mechanism by 2025 rising from $50/TeCO₂e in 2030  to $120 by 2050. Other non-OECD nations follow by imposing  prices of $10/TeCO₂e in 2030 rising to $60 by 2050. The  scenario assumes significant technological advances which  reduce battery, wind and solar generation costs, improve fuel  efficiencies for internal combustion engines (80% more fuel  efficient by 2050), improve energy efficiency in buildings and  lighting, and other impacts to energy production, delivery and  consumption."
Conoco Phillips_575,"Technology and efficiencies allow total energy  demand in 2050 to be 25% below 2019’s level with 50% of  energy provided by non-fossil fuels. The global oil market peaks in 2023, before significantly  declining thereafter. Energy storage improvements lead to EVs  achieving parity with internal combustion engine vehicles by  the mid-2020s, thus incentivizing climate-conscious consumers to purchase EVs. Consequently, 70% of the passenger  automobile fleet is electric in 2050, and transportation sector  demand falls to 25% of total oil demand. Oil supply dynamics  evolve as most production occurs in OPEC countries and  Russia and geopolitics play an even larger role in oil prices and  the supply and price of oil."
Conoco Phillips_580,"The natural gas market peaks in 2024. Natural gas generates  only 8% of global electricity in 2050, while wind and solar  grow to produce 60% of electricity in 2050. Global gas  demand shifts to emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East,  CIS and Africa. Only 26% of global gas demand remains in  North America and Europe. The market also becomes more  reliant on OPEC and Russia for supply as North American gas  output declines by over 58%."
Conoco Phillips_585,"In this scenario, countries and companies push for accelerated  progression along net-zero pathways and implement  supportive policies along with capital funding to progress  new technologies. Hydrogen remains a front-runner, with  blue (using CCS) and green hydrogen supporting increased  petrochemical and industrial activities over the medium  term. In the later part of the scenario, electrolysis costs fall  sharply, and green hydrogen accelerates along with other new  technologies, pushing out blue and grey (Steam Methane  Reforming) hydrogen production. Thus, the overall hydrogen  market grows to around 360 million metric tons in 2050. CCUS plays a critical role in emissions reduction, expanding to  3.4 gigatonnes by 2050."
Conoco Phillips_590,"Our scenarios have a wide range of assumptions regarding  technological advances, government policies (e.g., carbon  prices) and consumer behaviors leading to a range of oil  and natural gas prices. We take this future price uncertainty  into account in our strategy by using a fully burdened cost  of supply as our primary criteria for capital allocation. Of the  more than 20 billion barrels of resources with a cost of supply  below $40 per barrel held in our portfolio, the next decade  of production can be produced at an average cost of supply  below $28 per barrel. The scenarios are designed to address transitional risks. A separate scenario process addresses physical climate-related  risk using consultant scenarios based on the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) modeling."
Conoco Phillips_595,"3 All carbon taxes are in 2019 dollars. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 35 Strategy Climate Key Strategic Linkages to our  Scenario Planning Our corporate strategy reflects several findings from our  scenario analysis process. We have acted to:  ŰUse a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of  carbon aligned with our current probability-weighted  energy scenario, as an important metric in our project  authorization process. In 2021, we had a resource base  of over 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent with less than  a $40 per barrel cost of supply and an average cost of  supply of less than $30 per barrel. Our strategic objective  is to provide resilience in lower price environments, with  any oil price above our cost of supply generating an  after-tax fully burdened rate of return greater than 10%."
Conoco Phillips_600,"ŰPrepare for diverse policy environments by maintaining a  less than $40 per barrel of oil equivalent sustaining price  that could generate the cash to fund capital expenditure  to keep production flat over time and generate  competitive returns to shareholders. ŰMaintain diversification in our portfolio to be able to  balance our production and capital expenditures as  commodity prices become more volatile. ŰProvide competitive distributions from cash flows to  investors. ŰIdentify and fund emissions reduction projects to reduce  the impact of any future regulations, or the introduction  of carbon prices or taxes, and help maintain a low life- cycle cost of supply. We have upgraded the use of a  marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) in long-range  planning to identify the most cost-effective emissions  reduction opportunities available to the company  globally."
Conoco Phillips_605,"These process upgrades have resulted in more  efficient collection, recording, sharing and funding of  emissions reduction projects. ŰIntroduce a proxy cost of carbon into qualifying project  economics to help us be more resilient to climate-related  risk in the short- to medium-term and provide the  flexibility to remain resilient in the long-term. ŰFocus near-term technology investments on reducing  both our costs and our emissions where economically  feasible. ŰMonitor for potential disruptive technologies that might  impact the market for natural gas or oil, enabling us to  take advantage of our capital flexibility and reduce our  exposure to lower commodity prices at an early point  in time. ŰFocus on the carbon and cost competitive supply  of natural gas and oil while continuing to utilize our  scenario planning system to monitor and assess  additional business opportunities within the evolving  energy transition."
Conoco Phillips_610,"ŰPursue hydrogen production and carbon sequestration  as potentially attractive investments in meeting  transition demand for low carbon energy. ŰMonitor global regulatory and legislative developments  and engage in development of pragmatic policies  aligned with the climate policy principles outlined in our  Global Climate Change Position. Near-, Medium- and  Long -Term Risks As described in the Risk Management section, we evaluate  and track our climate-related risk through our SD Risk Register  and Climate Change Action Plan. Those risks broadly fall into  four categories:  ŰGHG related policy. ŰEmissions and emissions management."
Conoco Phillips_615,"ŰClimate-related disclosure and reporting. ŰPhysical climate-related impacts. The time horizons we use for climate-related issues are based  on the time taken for the risks to manifest themselves, our  planning time horizons and the time required to realize the  majority of the net present value of our projects. Near-Term Risks Our near-term time horizon is one to five years, during which  we can complete short-cycle drilling campaigns and small  projects. Our GHG forecasting and financial planning processes  are used to determine risks and opportunities that could have  a material financial impact for that period."
Conoco Phillips_620,"Our near-term  climate-related risks are generally government policy-related  and managed at the business unit level through policy  advocacy and technology to reduce emissions. Regulations to address climate-related risk, including GHG  emissions, are a near-term risk for several of our businesses. For  example, regulations issued by the Alberta government under  the Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act require  any facility existing in 2016, with emissions equal to or greater  than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 36 Strategy Climate per year, to reduce its net emissions intensity, with reduction  increases over time. The cost of compliance and investment  in emissions intensity reduction technologies influence  investment decisions for the Canada business unit, where we  are purchasing carbon offsets while evaluating and developing  technology opportunities to reduce emissions for existing and  new facilities. Good examples of technology developments  that decrease GHG intensity are our commercialization of  non-condensable gas co-injection at our oil sands operations  which improves our steam-to-oil ratios by 20-30%, and the  piloting of steam additives which has the potential for a 20%  improvement to our steam-to-oil ratio."
Conoco Phillips_625,"GHG emissions costs, or carbon costs, are another near-term  risk in some jurisdictions where we operate. For example,  in Norway, we are managing carbon cost risk with specific  actions to study operational emissions reduction opportunities  and evaluate project economics with the Norwegian carbon  fee and European Union CO₂ emissions costs included. While a price on carbon in the U.S. will increase our costs and  decrease demand for our product, we support a well-designed  pricing regime on carbon emissions as the most effective and  predictable policy action to reduce GHG emissions across the  economy. By enacting a legislative requirement for a price on  carbon, the U.S. would also maintain the energy advantage it  currently has while at the same time building credibility with  OECD countries and incentivizing other countries to also adopt  a price on carbon. We are members of the Carbon Pricing  Leadership Coalition (CPLC), a voluntary initiative working to  catalyze action towards the successful implementation of  carbon pricing around the world."
Conoco Phillips_630,"We are a Founding Member  of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), a collaboration of  business and environmental interests working to develop a  carbon dividend plan for the U.S. The plan has four key pillars:  a gradually increasing price on carbon, a carbon dividend,  border carbon adjustments and regulatory simplification. Read more about the carbon dividend plan on our website. Medium-Term Risks Our medium-term time horizon is six to 10 years, during  which we can complete most major projects and revise our  portfolio significantly if required. Our GHG forecasting and  financial planning processes are used to determine the risks  and opportunities that could have a material financial impact  for that period."
Conoco Phillips_635,"Medium-term risks take longer to impact our business and may include emerging policy that is not  yet fully defined. These risks are managed by business unit  planning but, if significant, may also be managed by corporate  strategies and company-wide risk assessments. Offset requirements have been identified as both a medium- term risk and as an opportunity for some business units where  carbon offsets can be used for compliance with an emissions  reduction program. Chronic physical changes are a medium-term risk for some  of our operations. Temperature extremes could impact  facilities located in Arctic regions if warmer temperatures  reduce the length of the ice road season and restrict well  and facility construction times."
Conoco Phillips_640,"Mitigation measures include  pre-packing to extend the start the of the ice road season, and  constructing and maintaining gravel roads to be resilient to  permafrost thawing. Long-Term Risks Our long-term time horizon is 1 1 years and beyond. Generally,  long-term risks are managed by our scenario analysis and  Climate Risk Strategy, as they include long-term government  policy, technology trends and consumer preferences that  affect supply and demand. They may also include risks that  align with long-term physical climate scenarios. We recognize that our GHG intensity will be compared against  peers, so we track this as a competitive risk at the corporate  level."
Conoco Phillips_645,"Investors, the financial sector and other stakeholders  compare companies based on climate-related performance,  and GHG intensity is a key indicator. For this reason, our GHG  intensity target aligns with the long-term time horizon to  ensure we manage the risk appropriately. It also demonstrates  our goal to be a leader in managing climate-related risk. Both chronic and acute physical climate risks are a long-term  risk for our business. In some parts of the U.S. we have  identified potential storm severity as a risk for future  operations, based on previous storms and flooding."
Conoco Phillips_650,"Consensus  science suggests that future extreme weather events may  become more intense or more frequent, thus potentially  adding incremental risk to our operations in coastal regions  and areas susceptible to typhoons or hurricanes. We have a  crisis management system in place to manage that risk before,  during and after a storm event.

Conoco Phillips_670,"• Increase application of mitigation measures (fresh water use minimization) in project design phase and  adjust project execution timing based on water availability. Investigate alternative sources for water (e.g. pipelines, desalination, etc.). Monitor stream flow and use forecast exercises to identify potential water  availability concerns in upcoming development. • Continue assessment of risk of permafrost thaw for construction of new infrastructure and implementation of  mitigation measures."

Actions within the plan  address individual risks identified by our business units or global/regional risks identified by our central corporate  staff. For example, both chronic and physical climate-related  impacts are more likely to apply to a single business unit, given  the specific local nature of the risk and geographical location  of our assets."
Conoco Phillips_680,"Actions relate to specific business units unless  indicated as “global.” ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 38 Strategy Climate including energy use, GHG management and environmental  supply chain risks. We continually work with suppliers to  find opportunities for GHG reductions in our operations and  engage with them for alignment with our energy transition  plan. We engage with suppliers through the bidding process  with questions on supplier GHG emissions and their own  Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets. We also engage through membership in several trade  associations, such as IPIECA, that address climate-related  issues through working groups and task forces that include  downstream businesses as well as suppliers. We continue to  monitor climate-related risks and opportunities related to our  supply chain and value chain and believe that maintaining  a global network of businesses and suppliers will mitigate  physical climate-related risks."
Conoco Phillips_685,"ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES While our business operations are designed and operated  to accommodate a range of potential climate conditions,  significant changes, such as more frequent severe weather  in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets are  located, could cause increased expenses and impact to our  operations. The costs associated with interrupted operations  will depend on the duration and severity of any physical event  and the damage and remedial work to be carried out. Financial  implications could include business interruption, damage or  loss of production uptime and delayed access to resources and  markets. For example, a three-day shutdown of all U.S. Gulf  Coast production would cause 732 MBOED in lost production. It is unlikely all our Gulf Coast area production would be  affected, as our operations are located across a wide span of  the coast including inland and offshore assets."
Conoco Phillips_690,"Business-resiliency planning is a process that helps us prepare  to mitigate potential physical risks of a changing climate  in a cost-effective manner. For example, in 2021, British  Columbia, Canada experienced one of its worst fire seasons  on record. The Montney development team has been making  a concerted effort to situate pads within existing cut blocks  where timber has been cleared to minimize the risk from  increased wildfire activity. Similarly, in response to previous  years’ increased wildfire activity in Alberta, our Surmont  team undertook reactive forest fuel reductions near critical  infrastructure. The team also installed a continuous monitoring Addressing Climate-Related  Risks with Strategic Planning  Business and Strategy  Climate-related risks have the potential to impact our  business in several ways."
Conoco Phillips_695,"Our SD risk management processes  identify those risks and assess the potential size, scope and  prioritization of each. We have aligned a description of these  impacts with the recommendations of the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD). PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  Compliance with policy changes that create a GHG tax,  fee, emissions trading scheme or GHG reductions could  significantly increase product costs for consumers and reduce  demand for natural gas- and oil-derived products. Demand  could also be eroded by conservation plans and efforts  undertaken in response to global climate-related risk, including  plans developed in connection with the Paris Agreement. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide,  tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and  development of alternative energy technologies that could  impact demand for our products."
Conoco Phillips_700,"However, there are also  opportunities associated with increased demand for lower- carbon energy sources such as natural gas to displace coal in  power generation and in combination with carbon capture  and storage in the production of hydrogen for industrial use. Our scenario analysis indicates that as the energy sector  transitions, it will be important to be competitive on both cost  of supply and GHG emissions intensity. We have adjusted our  portfolio to concentrate on lower-cost production and have  divested some of our natural gas and oil sands fields with  higher emissions intensity. We have also set a GHG emissions  intensity reduction target for our Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions. SUPPLY CHAIN AND/OR VALUE CHAIN We engage with suppliers  on the environmental and  social aspects of their operations through each step of the  procurement process, from supplier prequalification through  supplier performance evaluation."
Conoco Phillips_705,"This includes communicating  our expectations and priorities and identifying opportunities  for improvement and collaboration related to climate issues,  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 39 Strategy Climate sensor for particulate matter at our air quality monitoring  trailer at Surmont to protect human health. In addition  to mitigating fire risk, the Canada BU has also addressed  increased surface water flow from high-frequency and short- duration storm events in Surmont with increased on-site  training for managing the movement of water from well pads  and central processing facilities. This proactive surface water  management is critical in preventing on-site erosion from  damaging critical infrastructure. In 2021, our Australia Business Unit conducted climate water  catchment-level modeling to inform a drought risk assessment  to determine future impacts to water supply. Results showed  that long-term evaporation and long-term and severe drought  duration are projected to increase over the next 30 years in the  local area."
Conoco Phillips_710,"To mitigate this potential risk, both ConocoPhillips  and the local water authority are investigating supplementary  water supplies from alternate sources. We will use results from  this, and future updates to the risk assessment, to plan for  water availability in future operations as we adapt our practices  to a changing climate. Climate change is also considered during new project design. In 2019 in our Alaska BU, we updated our Foundational Design  Specification to increase the embedment depths for vertical  support members and piles to align with predicted soil  temperature trends. This revision updates the specification  based on temperature trends and geothermal modeling  predictions from 2020 through 2070."
Conoco Phillips_715,"Use of the Foundational  Design Specification continues to date. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Technology will play a major role in addressing GHG  emissions, whether through reducing fugitive emissions or  lowering the energy intensity of our operations or value chain. One way we incentivized and accelerated new technology  development was through our involvement in the Carbon  XPRIZE project in Canada, beginning in 2015. Seven of  Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) member companies, led by ConocoPhillips Canada, partnered with  NRG Energy, an integrated power company in the U.S., to back  a global competition to research technologies to capture  and transform CO₂ into valuable products. Ten finalist teams  competed for $20 million, with the competition concluding  in early 2021."
Conoco Phillips_720,"Read and view more about the Carbon XPRIZE  teams on our website . The two teams that converted the  greatest amount of CO₂ into products with the highest net  value while minimizing their environmental footprint were  selected as the grand prize winners. Another way we support technology development is through  our annual marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process. The MACC process identifies and prioritizes our emissions  reduction opportunities from operations based on the cost  per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent abated. This data  helps identify projects that might become viable in the future  through further research, development and deployment."
Conoco Phillips_725,"As a  result of this work, we have focused our near-term technology  investments on reducing both costs and emissions where  feasible, such as improving the steam-to-oil ratio in the oil  sands. Part of a new research and development effort is a  multilateral well technology pilot, which enables the drilling  of multiple lateral sections without the need for additional  aboveground capital or additional steam injection, thereby  reducing emissions intensity and operating costs. Over the past four years we have spent more than $450 million  on research and development, equipment, products and  services which have reduced our GHG emissions. Large-scale  commercial deployment projects include:  ŰEliminating the majority of methane emissions by using  air, rather than natural gas, to drive equipment at our  Montney development in Canada. ŰReducing emissions by electrifying plant and pad  equipment in Alaska."

OPERATIONS We have acted to mitigate our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  for many years. Our first Climate Change Action Plan was  introduced in 2008. In 2017 , we introduced a GHG emissions  intensity target to incentivize reductions in our production  operations as well as project design, exploration and portfolio  decisions."
Conoco Phillips_735,"To date, this has resulted in a reduction of both  our emissions intensity and our absolute emissions. Most of  the reduction projects carried out since 2008 have paid for  themselves through increased sales of natural gas. Around  two-thirds of the projects relate to the reduced emissions of  methane from reducing venting, updating plunger lifts or  replacing pneumatic controllers. To continue those reductions, we have set up regional teams  in North America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe to  use the MACC process to identify energy efficiency projects  for consideration in the Long-Range Plan. By evaluating our  day-to-day decisions regarding flaring, drilling, completions and equipment use we have gained a sharper focus on  energy consumption, along with increased revenue, reduced  energy costs, reduced emissions and an improved overall cost  of supply."
Conoco Phillips_740,"Read more about our MACC process and the Net-Zero  Roadmap on our website. We are one of more than 100 companies  participating in The Environmental Partnership , a  coalition of natural gas and oil companies focused  on accelerating environmental performance  improvements from operations across the United  States. The partnership prioritizes managing methane  emissions and aligns with our focus on emissions  reductions and high environmental standards. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 41 Strategy Climate Financial Planning We take climate-related issues into account in our financial  planning in several ways. In the short-to-medium term, we  use a range of commodity prices derived from our scenario  work."
Conoco Phillips_745,"In the longer term our scenarios provide insight into  the possibilities for future supply, demand and price of key  commodities. This helps us understand a range of risk around  commodity prices, and the potential price risk associated  with various GHG reduction scenarios. History has shown an  interdependency between commodity prices and operating  and capital costs. In the past, lower commodity prices have  driven down operating and capital costs, whereas the opposite  has been true when commodity prices have risen. We have  aligned a description of the potential impacts on financial  planning with the recommendations of the TCFD."
Conoco Phillips_750,"OPERATING COSTS AND REVENUES New or changing climate-related policy can impact our costs,  demand for fossil fuels, the cost and availability of capital and  exposure to litigation. The long-term impact on our financial  performance, either positive or negative, will depend on  several factors, including:  ŰExtent and timing of policy. ŰImplementation detail such as cap-and-trade or an  emissions tax or fee system. ŰGHG reductions required. ŰLevel of carbon price."

ŰExtent to which increased compliance costs are reflected  in the prices of our products and services."
Conoco Phillips_760,"The long-term financial impact from GHG regulations  is impossible to predict accurately, but we expect the  geographical reach of regulations and their associated costs  to increase over time. We model such increases and test our  portfolio in our long-term transitional scenarios.CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ALLOCATION We test our current portfolio of assets and investment  opportunities against the future prices generated from  our  corporate scenarios and identify where weaknesses may exist,  assisting with our capital allocation. As a result of our strategy  and scenario work, we have focused capital on lower cost- of-supply resources, reducing our investments in oil sands  and exiting deep water while increasing our investments  in unconventional oil projects. Following acquisitions in  the Permian in 2021, we have dramatically high-graded  our portfolio on the basis of both cost of supply and GHG  intensity and established capital allocation criteria that  ensure investments are directed to resources that best match  transition demand. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTMENTS Business development decisions consider the impact to our  portfolio from the financial, operational and sustainability  perspectives."
Conoco Phillips_765,"In our long-range planning process, we run  sensitivities on our GHG emissions intensity based on possible  acquisitions, divestments and project decisions. We focus on  cost of supply to account for lower and more volatile product  prices and possible introduction of carbon taxes. In recent  years, we have divested assets with higher emissions intensity,  such as oil sands and some older gas fields. ACCESS TO CAPITAL  In addition to cost of supply and carbon, we also strive to  compete more effectively by earning the confidence and trust  of the communities in which we operate, as well as our equity  and debt holders. We consider how our relative environmental,  social and governance performance could affect our standing  with investors and the financial sector, including banks and  credit-rating agencies."
Conoco Phillips_770,"An important priority in our corporate  strategy has been to pay down debt and target an “A” credit  rating to maintain, facilitate and ensure access to capital  through commodity price cycles. CARBON ASSET RISK Scenario analysis and our Climate Risk Strategy help build  optionality into our strategic plans to reduce the risk of  stranded assets. Key elements of our climate-related risk  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 42 Strategy Climate GHG PRICE We use GHG pricing to navigate GHG regulations, change  internal behavior, drive energy efficiency and low-carbon  investment, and stress test investments. In 2021, the company  used a range of estimated future costs of GHG emissions for  internal planning purposes, including an estimate of $60 per  tonne CO₂e applied beginning in the year 2024 as a sensitivity  to evaluate certain future projects and opportunities. We have  further developed the methodology by which qualifying  projects will include GHG pricing in their project approval  economics and long-term planning."
Conoco Phillips_775,"The base case for project  approval economics and planning will now include either the  forecast of existing GHG pricing regulations or our current  probability-weighted energy transition scenario for that  jurisdiction, depending on which is higher. Where there is no GHG price regulation, we use the current transition scenario for  that jurisdiction. We also run two sensitivities:  ŰWith only existing carbon pricing regulations, to reflect  near-term cash more accurately. ŰWith a sensitivity of $60 per tonne CO₂e, increased from  $40 per tonne, to act as a stress test to reduce the risk of  stranded assets should climate regulation accelerate. This ensures that both existing and emerging regulatory  requirements are considered in our planning and decision  making."

ŰIncorporating risk mitigation actions into the Long- Range Plan and Climate Change Action Plan."
Conoco Phillips_785,"We have taken action to reduce our cost of supply and are the  only oil and natural gas company to transparently disclose the  full cost of supply of our resource base. Combined with our  belief that we have the lowest sustaining capital required to  maintain flat production among our peers, this demonstrates a  competitive advantage in reducing carbon asset risk. The cost of supply of our resource base supports our assertion that  resources with the lowest cost of supply are most likely to be  developed in scenarios with lower demand, such as the IEA’s  Sustainable Development Scenario. All U.S. publicly traded companies must adhere to a consistent  set of regulations that enable investors to evaluate and  compare investment choices. We fully comply with rules and  regulations, including for reporting natural gas and oil reserves."
Conoco Phillips_790,"In order to meet the Securities and Exchange Commission  requirement that reserve estimates be based on current  economic conditions, our reported reserves are determined by  applying a carbon tax only in jurisdictions with existing carbon  tax requirements.

ŰMaintain capital discipline:  Use scenario analysis  and a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of  carbon, as the primary basis for capital allocation. Our plan does not include a Scope 3 (end-use) emissions  target. A Scope 3 target for an exploration and production  company represents a prescribed curtailment of production  and a shift of capital away from existing transition demand,  whereas our responsibility to shareholders is to strongly  compete for that demand.

Cost of supply is the primary metric that  we use for capital allocation, and it has the advantage of being  independent of price forecasts. Any oil price above the cost of  supply will generate an after-tax fully burdened return that is  greater than 10%.OIL PRICES BY IEA SCENARIO $/BBL 1 Stated Energy Policies Scenario 2 Announced Pledges Case: Net-zero pledges 3 Sustainable Development Scenario: Meet clean air, energy access and climate SDGs 4 Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario: Roadmap to 2050.STEPS1APC2SDS3NZE4 US $ 2020 Real in 2020 42 42 42 42 US $ 2020 Real in 2030 77 67 56 35 US $ 2020 Real in 2050 88 64 50 24The cost of supply of our resource base supports our assertion  that resources with the lowest cost of supply are most likely  to be developed in scenarios with lower demand, such as  the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario. As of year-end  2021, we held resources of more than 20 billion barrels of  oil equivalent (BOE) with a cost of supply below $40 per  barrel WTI and an average cost of supply of approximately  $30 per barrel WTI. Over the next decade, we will produce  approximately 7 billion barrels of resource with an average cost  of supply below $28 per barrel diversified across the regions  described below."
Conoco Phillips_855,"In recent years we have dramatically high-graded our portfolio  and implemented stringent capital allocation criteria that  direct investments to resources that will best match transition  demand. Over the next 10 years, our focus is on assets that  have both a low cost of supply and lower GHG intensity. Importantly, each asset type competes within its unique  market (e.g., LNG, oil sands) where they compete on the basis  of their relative GHG intensity and cost of supply. Our portfolio  of assets compete within their respective markets, meet high  ESG performance standards and provide additional resilience  through asset and global diversity. Just as the company is focused on developing resources with  low cost of supply, we are equally focused on developing low  GHG intensity resources as these are the resources most likely  to compete in any future energy transition pathway."
Conoco Phillips_860,"ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 47 Strategy Climate PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION The mix and location of the resources in our portfolio  demonstrate flexibility and the ability to adapt to change  as we monitor scenarios and global trends. Our short-cycle  project times and capital flexibility enable us to redirect capital  to the most competitive basins. Our extensive low cost of  supply resource base allows us to divest higher cost assets to  high-grade our portfolio as our strategy evolves. This applies  to both hydrocarbon mix and geographic region. If policy in  a country or region significantly impacts cost of supply, we  can shift capital to other opportunities."
Conoco Phillips_865,"Examples include our presence in the oil sands business in Canada and in North  American natural gas. Changing market fundamentals led us  to significantly reduce our focus on both, while our portfolio  diversity enabled expansion in other areas. CAPITAL AND OPERATING SPEND Our strategy is also made more robust by discipline in capital  and operating costs.

Conoco Phillips_870,"Its remit is to develop the corporate Net-Zero Roadmap  for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, understand the new energies  landscape, and prioritize opportunities for future competitive  investment. We are approaching this effort with the same  discipline that we approach exploration in our traditional  business, keeping seed costs low, leveraging competencies,  identifying economically viable opportunities with materiality  and flexibility, and only increasing investment once risks are  managed and returns are assured. The Low Carbon Technologies organization works across  the company’s business units to develop and implement  region-specific Net-Zero Roadmaps with detailed, time-bound  actions, identify technology solutions for hard-to-abate  emissions, pilot new methods to reduce and accelerate  emissions reductions, and evaluate newly emerging  competitive opportunities. This organization also supported  pre-development work in 2021 to evaluate large-scale wind  energy opportunities to provide power for our operations in  the Permian, North Sea and Bohai Bay.

In 2021, we evaluated potential CO₂ storage sites along the  Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast to determine the feasibility  of supplying CCS services to industrial emitters. We are also  evaluating opportunities to deploy CCS in our own operations. For example, we recently joined the Oil Sands Pathways  to Net-Zero Initiative, an alliance of Canada’s top oil sands  operators that is working toward achieving net-zero GHG  emissions by 2050."

We plan to develop and support our own offset projects and  make diversified investments in offset projects or funds. Our  focus will be on countries/regions in which we operate or have  land holdings. While at present we do not anticipate the need  to utilize offsets to meet our medium-term targets, we plan  to begin investing now to secure a lower-cost position for the  future.

Conoco Phillips_910,"This system links directly to the ERM process, which includes  an annual risk review by executive leadership and the Board  of Directors. Assessing Climate-Related  Risks  The diagram below illustrates how we assess climate-related  physical and transition risks for operations, developments and  new major projects. To understand long-term risk and mitigation options, we  utilize four scenarios as described in the  Scenario Planning  at ConocoPhillips  section of our website. Depending on the  deployment of carbon capture and storage and negative  emissions technologies beyond 2050, we believe three of  the scenarios may be capable of achieving an emissions  trajectory consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement. This scenario approach helps us evaluate distinct outcomes  related to the potential timing and intensity of government  climate change policy development, the pace of alternative  energy technology development and trends in consumer  behavior."

We use Scenario Planning  to understand  long-term risk and mitigation options through  the energy transition. The Emissions Reduction Targets  set out in our  Climate Risk Strategy describe our goals to 2050. We periodically review emerging climate-related risks with  our Executive Leadership Team as part of our scenario  monitoring system."
Conoco Phillips_920,"A cross-functional team enters events  into a centralized database that is reviewed regularly for  indications that risks are changing or developing. We use this  “early warning” system to inform our strategies in a timely  manner so that we can identify and implement effective  mitigation measures. The scenario monitoring system helps  us understand the pace and direction of the energy transition. For example, if regulations and technology were moving  more quickly than in our scenarios, this would indicate that  we might be moving to a 1.5-degree scenario similar to the  range identified in the IPCC “1.5 degree” report, and we would  take action accordingly. In our resiliency workshops, we use  externally produced scenarios that describe the range of  possible future physical risk."
Conoco Phillips_925,"ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 52 Climate Risk ManagementAnnual Assessment As part of the annual risk management process mandated  by our SD Risk Management Standard, we examine operated  assets and major projects against the physical, social and  political settings of our operations. Subject matter experts  in each business unit (BU) and project identify and describe  climate-related risks. Each risk is then assessed using a matrix that evaluates  both its likelihood and consequence. Risks rated significant  or high are included in the corporate SD Risk Register. In  evaluating the consequence level, we consider potential  impacts on employee and public safety, sociocultural and  economic impacts to stakeholders, environmental impact, and  reputational and financial implications."
Conoco Phillips_930,"As part of the process, we examine the interdependence  of risks and work to identify emerging risks such as new  regulatory requirements and emerging GHG pricing regimes. Resiliency Planning Workshops  We facilitate resiliency planning workshops within business  units to identify and assess the risks and opportunities  associated with the physical impacts of changing climate and  the potential technology and solutions to mitigate risks and  leverage opportunities. These workshops are conducted on  a periodic basis to ensure that our operations have access to  up-to-date science provided by qualified consultants to inform  their engineering and infrastructure decisions. Climate-Related Risk Assessment A climate-related risk assessment is conducted on any future  project development that costs more than $50 million net  and is expected to emit more than 25,000 metric tons CO₂  equivalent (TeCO₂e) net to ConocoPhillips during any year  of its operational lifespan. This assessment is mandatory for  investment approval in our project authorization process."
Conoco Phillips_935,"Project teams for qualifying projects are required to assess  the potential risks and opportunities associated with GHG  emissions, GHG regulation and a physically changing climate  based on local jurisdictions and geographies as opposed to using our corporate scenarios. The climate risk assessment  guidelines provide a framework for project teams to:  ŰForecast operational GHG emissions for the life of the  project. ŰEvaluate climate-related risks and opportunities,  including physical and transition risks that apply to the  project. ŰMake decisions on GHG emissions control in project  design, including energy efficiency solutions, power  source selection, emissions management, carbon  capture and storage/utilization, and external compliance  options such as the purchase or origination of GHG  offsets. ŰEvaluate the potential cost of GHG emissions in project  economics."
Conoco Phillips_940,"We assess climate-related risks early in the project engineering  stage to better inform our investment decisions and facility  design. The ConocoPhillips Health, Safety and Environment  (HSE) Due Diligence Standard also provides further guidance  on accounting for sustainable development issues for new  acquisitions, new business ventures, joint ventures and real  property transactions. Project Authorization Our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying  projects to include GHG pricing in their project approval  economics. The base case for project approval economics  now includes the higher of the forecast of existing regulations  and the current transition scenario for that jurisdiction. Where  there is no GHG price regulation, we use the current transition  scenario for that jurisdiction."
Conoco Phillips_945,"We also run two sensitivities:  ŰWith existing carbon pricing regulations, to reflect  near-term cash more accurately. ŰWith a sensitivity of $60 per tonne CO₂e to act as a stress  test to reduce the risk of stranded assets should climate  regulation accelerate. This ensures that both existing and emerging regulatory  requirements are considered in our planning and  decision making.

Conoco Phillips_1025,"Our methane emissions reductions come from voluntary  reduction activities and from portfolio changes. Similar to  overall GHG emissions in 2021, absolute methane emissions  increased due to the acquisition of additional Permian assets,  however our methane intensity declined to 2.6kg CO₂e/BOE  or 13% from our 2019 baseline, exceeding our current target of  10% reduction by 2025. In 2021, methane emissions totaled 1.8 million tonnes of CO₂e  and constituted 9.6% of our total GHG emissions. FLARING  Flaring is a regulated and permitted process for the controlled  release and burning of natural gas during oil and gas  exploration, production and processing operations. Flaring is  required to safely dispose of flammable gas released during  process upsets or other unplanned events and to safely relieve  pressure before performing equipment maintenance."
Conoco Phillips_1030,"Flaring  is also used to control and reduce emissions of volatile organic  compounds from oil and condensate storage tanks, and to  manage emissions at well sites that lack sufficient pipeline  infrastructure to capture gas for sale. Setting a target to get to zero routine flaring by 2030, with an  ambition to get there by 2025, is a key near-term action within  our ambition to become a net-zero company by 2050. While  our flaring emissions make up only about 9% of our total GHG  emissions, the target will drive continued near-term focus on  routine flaring reductions across our assets. Routine flaring is defined as flaring of associated gas that occurs during the  normal production of oil in the absence of sufficient facilities  to utilize the gas onsite, dispatch it to a market or re-inject it. Flaring for safety reasons, non-routine flaring or flaring gas  other than associated gas is not included as part of the World  Bank Zero Routine Flaring initiative."
Conoco Phillips_1035,"In 2021, the total volume of flared gas was 20.5 BCF, an increase  of 41% from 2020. The increase was a result of increased flaring  in the Permian due to the acquisition of Concho Resources. It was also a result of availability of more accurate data for  estimating the volume of gas that is used as assist gas in our  Eagle Ford asset. While absolute flaring volumes increased, our flaring⁵ intensity  continues to decline, decreasing 4% in 2021. Routine flaring  volumes were collected for the first time in 2021."
Conoco Phillips_1040,"Routine  flaring represents only 5% of our total volume of gas flared.

The target covers Scope 1 and  Scope 2 gross operated and net equity emissions as these  are the emissions over which we have the most control. Our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and emissions intensity  calculations directly measure our climate performance and  help us understand climate transition risk."
Conoco Phillips_1045,"For example,  our ability to manage GHG emissions can help us measure  resilience to emerging carbon tax regulation.The company has already progressed toward meeting this  target over the past several years. Between 2016 and 2021, we  achieved a 32% intensity reduction on a gross operated basis  through a combination of specific emissions reduction projects  and asset changes. Continued capital allocation actions  are expected to have a combined impact of lowering GHG  emissions intensity by roughly 8-18% as we increase production  from assets with low intensity, such as those in the Permian  Basin, and achieve reductions from near-term projects. The target includes emissions that are related to production  and excludes emissions from our aviation and polar tankers  fleets.

Conoco Phillips_1055,"NET EQUITY AND NON-OPERATED EMISSIONS Compared to our gross operated emissions, our net equity  emissions were slightly lower in 2021 as a result of our  operating partners’ activities, at 18.3 million tonnes CO₂e. However, our net equity intensity is higher at 32.4 kg  CO₂e/BOE than our gross operated intensity of 26.6 kg  CO₂e/BOE, showing increased efficiency in our operated  assets. About 40% of our net-equity emissions are from  non-operated assets. Because we approach net-zero as a  shared challenge, we look to influence our joint operating  partners’ climate risk strategies and net-zero targets and  align our emissions reductions activity. We have initiated a  concerted effort to advance this joint approach in our Alaska  and Australia business units, opening dialogue on critical  emissions reductions with our key operating partners."
Conoco Phillips_1060,"Long-Term Emissions Reductions   (By 2050) The long-term pathway to achieving our net-zero emissions  ambition by 2050 starts with proven, well-defined actions  for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while also advancing less  mature but potentially economically and technically viable  low-carbon opportunities. The aggregated near- and  medium-term efforts described in previous sections set  the foundation for our roadmap to net-zero emissions  represented in the Net-Zero Roadmap. The shading on the  bars represents the level of maturity today. The first step of the roadmap includes continuing the  well-established, identified operational Scope 1 and 2  projects that are currently underway. The identification and  implementation of these projects are supported by strong  internal process and capabilities."
Conoco Phillips_1065,"Continuous portfolio high  grading is also a mature capability in ConocoPhillips. The  bottom two bars of the roadmap show carbon capture  opportunities and offsets. A multi-disciplinary Low Carbon  Technologies organization, comprised of some of our best  technical, financial, business development and commercial  talent, is overseeing these channels.

Conoco Phillips_1070,"Each year, the executive leadership team determines  which projects to fund based on a number of criteria  including capital efficiency (i.e. the lowest $/TeCO₂ equivalent),  scalability, and repeatability among a few others. We fund  projects that have a break-even cost of up to $60/Te CO₂e,  as well as projects that anticipate forthcoming regulatory  changes. We have allocated $200 million in the 2022 capital  budget to energy transition activities, a majority of which will  address Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction projects across our  global operations selected through this program. The projects sanctioned for 2022, some of which are multi-year  projects, could represent a recurring annualized reduction of approximately one million tonnes of CO₂e upon completion."
Conoco Phillips_1075,"These include production efficiency measures, methane and  flaring intensity-reduction initiatives and asset electrification  projects, specifically:  ŰMethane:  Switch instrumentation from gas-driven to  air-driven pneumatics; modify facilities to reduce gas  venting. ŰFlaring: Incorporate vapor recovery units at facilities;  recover waste gas for sales. ŰElectrification and combustion:  Reduce combustion  needs on drilling and completions; electrify operations  and pursue renewable energy sources; conduct basin- wide electrification study in the Permian; evaluate a  project to electrify central facilities in a portion of our  Eagle Ford operations. ŰOperational efficiency:  Streamline facilities, tanks and  equipment; improve waste heat utilization, insulation  and power distribution. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 63 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsMETHANE DETECTION IN   U.S. OPERATIONS ConocoPhillips utilizes a variety of leak detection and repair  (LDAR) tools throughout our operations to identify and repair  methane leaks."
Conoco Phillips_1080,"First, we conduct LDAR surveys as required by  NSPS Subpart OOOOa and other state regulatory frameworks. Second, we utilize various innovative technologies that go  above and beyond those required by regulations. These  technologies are deployed at selected assets with the intent of  evaluating and understanding their limitations and advantages. In addition, ConocoPhillips participates in a variety of voluntary  LDAR programs offered through industry organizations, trade  associations and joint partnerships. Examples of technologies  currently in use are summarized below."
Conoco Phillips_1085,"Informal Inspections ConocoPhillips personnel visit sites as part of their routine duties  or in response to any operational issues at the sites. They identify  any anomalous operating conditions that may contribute to  audio, visual or olfactory (AVO) indications of potential leaks. Audio Visual Olfactory (AVO) Inspections We conduct formal AVO inspections to identify potential leaks  at sites where regulatorily required, typically on a weekly basis. On most other sites where not regulatorily required, we perform  these inspections periodically on a voluntary basis. Instrument-based Method 21 Inspections Where required by regulatory programs, we conduct LDAR  inspections pursuant to requirements of U.S. EPA Reference  Method 21, using an organic vapor analyzer.Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) Camera Inspections We perform periodic inspections at sites using OGI cameras  where required by NSPS OOOOa regulations."
Conoco Phillips_1090,"In addition,  at sites not subject to NSPS OOOOa regulations, we conduct  periodic OGI inspections on a voluntary basis. In addition  to the above LDAR methods either required by or based on  regulatory requirements, ConocoPhillips continues to pilot  and utilize innovative methods of monitoring, including some  airborne and ground-based systems. The pilot programs and  limited deployments of innovative technologies discussed  below are not used for regulatory purposes. Airborne Systems We have piloted several aerial technologies that enable routine  monitoring over a larger area and allow for inspection of  multiple facilities at a time. Airborne systems are an established  way of screening of emissions from an entire facility, a group of  facilities or a wider geographic area."
Conoco Phillips_1095,"Drone-mounted technology has proven effective in detecting  and locating the source of leaks due to their low-altitude  capabilities; we currently use these on an ad-hoc basis. We have also utilized airplanes with mounted sensors to fly  over facilities to detect leaks. If leaks are suspected, operations  personnel take action to verify and repair the leak. The airplane  sensors can detect smaller leaks, but our experience indicates  that their effectiveness at pinpointing exact locations can be  diminished in areas where other facilities are in close proximity,  like the Permian Basin. ConocoPhillips has worked with  Scientific Aviation to fly fixed-wing aircraft carrying detection Scope 1 and 2 Emissions Reduction ActivitiesFor example, through our MACC process, we have progressed  the piloting of steam additives in the Canadian oil sands to  improve thermal efficiency, reduce GHG emissions intensity  and enhance incremental oil production."
Conoco Phillips_1100,"In the U.S. Lower  48, we have changed the design of some new facilities to  include instrument air packages rather than gas-driven  devices, reducing methane emissions from those sites. To  continue those reductions, we have set up regional teams in  North America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe to use the  MACC process to identify additional energy efficiency projects. Output from the MACC informs our annual budget, long-range  plan and technology strategy.Projects below the line are economic and have a negative  breakeven cost of carbon. Projects above the line are not  economic – the taller the bar, the higher the breakeven cost  of carbon. The width of the bar indicates the annual emissions  saving that would occur should the project be undertaken –  the wider the bar, the greater the emissions saving."
Conoco Phillips_1105,Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction activities and MACC  projects are described in the following section. Read more  about our MACC process and the Net-Zero Roadmap on  our website. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 64 Climate Performance Metrics and Targetsgear over our Permian assets. We have also contracted with  LeakScout to periodically fly helicopters equipped with OGI  cameras around select sites. This program has also proven  effective in identifying leaks.
Conoco Phillips_1110,"While many of these airborne technologies are good at  detecting leaks, they do require personnel following up with  hand-held OGI cameras to identify the exact location of the  leaks and the equipment involved, after which we conduct  repairs and ensure mitigation was successful. Satellite-based detection technology is another large-scale  leak detection option. Although its effectiveness is improving  rapidly, it has limitations in areas where facilities are located  within close proximity to one another, such as in the Permian. An additional drawback has been the inability to identify  small to medium leaks. Recently launched satellites are  showing promise in providing better imaging and allowing  more frequent monitoring of specific facilities."
Conoco Phillips_1115,"Although  ConocoPhillips has used satellite detection in the Permian,  we plan to pause its use until the technology shows further  improvement. Additionally, the company has implemented monitoring  systems to monitor for leaks on a continuous basis, as  described below: Continuous Monitoring Systems: Scientific Aviation  (Metal Oxide-based SOOFIE Sensors) ConocoPhillips has worked with Scientific Aviation to  develop and test continuous methane monitoring devices  at select Lower 48 facilities to further enhance LDAR  capabilities. The SOOFIE (Systematic Observations of Facility  Intermittent Emissions) sensor is a relatively simple method  that incorporates cost-effective metal oxide sensors. Three  to six sensors are affixed to poles strategically placed around  locations to maximize effectiveness during varying wind  conditions. Any elevated methane concentrations picked  up by the SOOFIE sensors are integrated into an automated  machine learning system that considers details such as  equipment location, distance, wind speed and direction to  identify the most probable emissions source."
Conoco Phillips_1120,"Lower 48 and Alaska Setting a methane emissions intensity target ensures  continued focus on methane emissions reductions, including designing new facilities to avoid methane emissions as much  as practical. We have evaluated ways to improve well pad  and central facility design to reduce GHG emissions, including  emissions capture and suppression and installing vapor  recovery units. For example, in 2021 we completed a project  in the Bakken installing vapor recovery units on several new  facility builds, as well as a project in the Permian installing a  vapor return line on a central tank battery to reduce emissions  from truck loading. We are participating in API’s The Environmental Partnership,  a coalition of about 100 natural gas and oil companies  working to improve methane emissions management. The  program utilizes Bridger Photonics to fly aircraft at a program- determined frequency over industry assets, including those of  ConocoPhillips."
Conoco Phillips_1125,"As part of our commitment, we have focused  on two key areas:  ŰLDAR programs: In 2021, we conducted approximately  7 ,600 surveys across our assets to detect leaks  and quickly repair them. While this is a regulatory  requirement in many areas, over 50% of the surveys were  done voluntarily. These surveys continue to provide a  better understanding of where leaks occur and how we  can minimize fugitive emissions. ŰEliminating gas-driven pneumatic devices: Many of our  greenfield designs at new facilities include devices to  use supplied air instead of site gas to reduce natural gas  emissions from pneumatics. We continue to test and deploy new methane detection  technologies, including continuous monitoring."
Conoco Phillips_1130,"For example,  in Alaska we began a project in 2021 to install fuel flow meters  on existing Kuparuk drill site heaters to more accurately  calculate emissions. While continuous monitoring technology is proving to work  well for expeditiously identifying and mitigating leaks, our  reported emissions for the U.S. continue to be based on the  EPA-mandated methodology for reporting GHG emissions. Canada Our new development in Montney was designed to eliminate  the majority of methane emissions by utilizing self-generated  electricity and electric equipment rather than traditional  natural gas driven equipment. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 65 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsFLARING  Lower 48 We have reduced flaring by utilizing closed-loop completions,  central gas gathering systems, vapor recovery units, directing  condensate to sales pipelines and improving uptime through  operational excellence (a major focus for all our operating  facilities). ŰOver 2019 and 2020 we worked with midstream gas  gatherer OneOK to expand and optimize their gas  processing infrastructure in the Bakken."
Conoco Phillips_1135,"We also worked  to debottleneck our own facilities. In 2021, this work  resulted in a 50% reduction in routine flaring compared  to 2020, despite a ~40% increase in total gas production. ŰWe have also implemented production deferral practices  when offtake is constrained and we are progressing  field-wide deployment of gas capture technologies. ŰIn the Eagle Ford, we began a project in 2021 that uses  an optical gas imaging (OGI) camera transmitter to send  a feedback signal to the flare blower’s speed controller. This improves combustion of flare gases by allowing  for continual air adjustment, ultimately resulting in CO₂  abatement."
Conoco Phillips_1140,"ŰIn the Delaware Basin, we have built and operate our  own gathering system, which enables more flexibility  and connections to multiple third-party processors. We  have also developed and implemented facility design  changes to reduce or eliminate flaring from tanks. ŰWe use Andium cameras to monitor flares at some sites. These cameras provide visual observation of flares that  can be monitored at centralized locations, providing  quick notice of any anomalous flaring events. Norway In the North Sea, we are reducing our safety flaring by  installing a new flare gas re-compressor that will reduce  emissions from the flare tower at Ekofisk 2/4 J by more than  90%, or 26,000 tonnes per year."
Conoco Phillips_1145,"Instead of gas being flared, it  will now be sold to the European market.OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY  Canada Reducing the GHG emissions intensity of our in situ  oil sands operations continues to be a priority for our  Canada operations. We are using technology to co-inject  non-condensable gas (NCG) with steam to reduce steam  requirements and increase production at Surmont. This  allows for a reduction in the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) and  consequent reduction in GHG emissions intensity. The  technology can be applied to almost any steam-assisted  gravity drainage (SAGD) operation, resulting in GHG intensity  reductions of approximately 15-35%. Early project results have  been shared with Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance   (COSIA) Innovation Plus consortia to encourage widespread  deployment of the technology throughout Canada’s oil sands."
Conoco Phillips_1150,"In response to lower oil prices from the COVID-19 pandemic,  in 2020 and 2021, the BU developed a new co-injection  alternative, “NCG Lite,” to allow for the continued injection  of NCG during curtailment without the need for additional  infrastructure installation. We are also piloting multilateral well technology including  innovative drilling and completion methods and thermal  junction technology in existing vertical wellbores to increase  production from a single surface location. Thermal junction  technology enables the drilling of multiple lateral sections  without the need for additional aboveground infrastructure. These wells reduce surface footprint and provide increased  bitumen production without additional steam injection,  thereby reducing GHG emissions intensity and operating costs  per barrel of bitumen. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 66 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsBoth technology projects have benefited from financial  support provided through Emissions Reduction Alberta  (ERA)."
Conoco Phillips_1155,"ERA invests the proceeds from carbon pricing paid by large  industrial emitters into Alberta’s Technology Innovation and  Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation to reduce GHGs and  strengthen the competitiveness of new and incumbent  industries in Alberta. These investments help innovators  develop and demonstrate GHG reducing technologies that  lower costs, improve competitiveness, and accelerate Alberta’s  transformation to a low-carbon economy. Lower 48 In the Permian, we began a study to evaluate the possibility of  reinjecting produced gas along with injection water by utilizing  the existing water injection system. This simultaneous water  and gas injection has the potential to avoid gas processing downtime and allow for continuous operation of the asset. Another operational efficiency project in the Permian involves  replacing diesel fuel with a battery pack and smart controller  on drilling rigs."
Conoco Phillips_1160,"This aims to reduce the number of generators  needed during high transient loads while also matching the  number of generators running with the actual load required,  reducing total energy usage of the rig. Australia As an early feasibility assessment, the APLNG flashing liquid  expander project proposes to install a two-phase flashing  liquid expander within the liquefaction section of a single  train at APLNG. Installing this expander improves the energy  efficiency of the liquefaction process as a train can produce  more LNG for the same compression power. An expander project at APLNG aims to improve the energy efficiency of the liquefaction  process, allowing a train to produce more LNG for the same compression power. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 67 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsELECTRIFICATION AND ALTERNATIVE POWER Lower 48 We evaluate opportunities to use power from the grid, waste  gas generators or alternative energy such as solar rather than  natural gas."
Conoco Phillips_1165,"After a successful pilot in 2020, we initiated a project in 2021  to utilize lower-carbon alternative fuel sources in the Permian. Rather than relying solely on diesel fuel to power fracking  operations, the project aims to use compressed natural gas  and liquefied natural gas to electrically power hydraulic  fracturing (e-frac) fleets. We believe these fleets are a viable technology to lower  operational emissions by replacing diesel usage with field  gas or CNG while improving productive time by reducing  maintenance and generating more usable horsepower. We  are also planning to conduct further field testing of e-frac  fleets in our Lower 48 operations. They can also be used in  combination with diesel in dual-fuel frac fleets to reduce  emissions associated with traditional fracking operations."
Conoco Phillips_1170,"These innovations along with innovations in efficiency, water  and safety are also providing significant cost savings and  emissions reductions per well. We are also conducting two feasibility studies in the Permian. The first is a solar plant study that aims to determine the  feasibility of installing a photovoltaic solar plant to power  operations and sell surplus energy to the current electricity  provider. The study will also evaluate technical conditions for  connection of the solar plant to the existing power grid. The second is an infrastructure and electrification study."
Conoco Phillips_1175,"The  first part of the study aims to find a solution for a dual problem:  pipeline constraints for excess natural gas and a lack of water  reuse/treatment options. Centralized water handling, including  reverse osmosis and desalination, would be powered by in situ  natural gas converted to electric compression. If successful,  the project would provide an option to reuse produced water,  avoid reinjection to saltwater disposal wells, limit natural  gas sales at suboptimal prices, and pave the way for field  electrification. To further the field electrification component, the second part of the study aims to better understand the  long-term load demand for the total basin as well as upgrades  that may be required if the basin was to fully electrify. This  aspect of the project is especially important as we have a  collective need to decarbonize the basin at a more rapid  pace."
Conoco Phillips_1180,"As part of this project, we have engaged with several  key Permian operators representing about 60% of Permian  Basin production to collaborate on these infrastructure and  electrification solutions. China Our operations in Bohai Bay, China are powered by fuel gas  from associated natural gas production from developed  fields. The asset will increasingly face a fuel gas shortage by  the mid-2020s, increasing operating costs due to the need to  purchase natural gas at local market rates. The China business  unit (BU) is reviewing multiple opportunities to bridge the fuel  gas gap, including:   ŰBuilding localized offshore wind turbines specific for the  asset. ŰDeveloping shallow gas fields to increase gas supply to  continue powering operations."
Conoco Phillips_1185,"ŰInstalling transformer station and subsea cables and  tying into CNOOC regional offshore power grid that  connects to onshore power facilities. ŰJointly developing a large offshore wind farm with  CNOOC Renewables to support the fulfillment of the  BU’s net-zero emissions in the long run. Norway Norway’s carbon tax system and high-tax regime for oil and  gas operations helps improve the economics of investing  in electrification solutions. The Norway BU is investigating  multiple options to achieve partial electrification in our Ekofisk  operations, including:  ŰSmall-scale local offshore wind development  (preliminary concept with two 10-14 MW turbines) to  replace gas-powered turbines at Ekofisk, achieving about  60,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions reductions per year. ŰConnection to a possible future offshore wind power  hub with subsea power cables connected to shore."
Conoco Phillips_1190,"ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 68 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsOur role to address Scope 3 emissions and  accelerate the energy transition includes several  focus areas. ŰAdvocating for policy to address  end-use emissions  through support of an  economywide price on carbon. ŰAddressing upstream supply chain  emissions  by engaging with major  suppliers on our Climate Risk Strategy. ŰEvaluating renewable energy into our  operations  through power purchase  agreements or building solar or wind  opportunities to support growing market  demand of alternative energy. ŰInvesting in new energies  and mitigation  measures such as carbon capture and  storage and hydrogen.Addressing Scope 3 Emissions While we recognize that end-use emissions must be reduced  to meet global climate objectives, we believe that setting a  Scope 3 target for a Paris-aligned exploration and production  company misplaces the focus on emissions reductions that  can only occur in subsequent parts of the value chain and  instead represents a prescribed curtailment of production."
Conoco Phillips_1195,"While a sector-wide reduction in demand for oil and natural  gas products is foreseen as the transition progresses, our  responsibility to shareholders is to strongly compete to supply  that demand. We do so by striving for the lowest cost of  supply, lowest GHG intensity production. Although projections from a broad range of energy demand  scenarios show a likely decline in oil and natural gas demand  over coming decades, they also estimate that trillions of  dollars of oil and natural gas investment will still be needed  to ensure sufficient production capacity exists to meet even  conservative demand projections. Placing a requirement on efficient, ESG-focused, upstream  companies like ConocoPhillips to meet a Scope 3 emissions  reduction target could have the effect of shifting capital  away from responsible operators toward less-accountable  producers and jurisdictions. To meet a Scope 3 target, an  exploration and production company would need to shift its  capital to alternative energy products or curtail production."
Conoco Phillips_1200,"This capital shift would not necessarily reduce global emissions  because it does not impact the oil and gas demand that is  predicted across any Paris-aligned transition pathway. Other  key considerations have also reinforced our rationale at  ConocoPhillips not to set a Scope 3 target. E&P Company versus Integrated Company Pure play exploration and production companies do not  have the opportunities to influence end-use emissions  that integrated oil and gas companies hold through their  ownership and control over the production and sale  of end-use energy products. As an upstream producer,  ConocoPhillips does not control how the commodities we  sell are converted into different products or ultimately used,  providing limited range of viable actions by the company  beyond Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions. “The bulk of emissions occur in end-use."
Conoco Phillips_1205,"So the  most effective and efficient means of reducing  global emissions must include mechanisms  that can directly impact consumer demand for  carbon intensive energy.” — DOMINIC MACKLON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGY,  SUSTAINABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 69 Climate Performance Metrics and TargetsSOURCEESTIMATED MILLION  TONNES CO₂ e Upstream transportation 4 Downstream transportation 9 Processing of sold product 13 Use of sold product 198Double Counting Enactment of a Scope 3 emissions target would inevitably  result in duplication of end-use emissions accounting  along the oil and natural gas value chain, making accurate  accounting and credible target-setting extremely problematic. For example, the Scope 3 emissions from refining the oil we  produce are a refiner’s Scope 1 emissions. The combustion of  that oil in the form of an end-use product such as gasoline  are also Scope 3 emissions for the producer of the oil, the  refiner and the marketer. The combustion of gasoline is  also a Scope 1 emission for distribution and transportation  companies. Likewise, our Scope 3 emissions from the  combustion of natural gas at a power station would be the  electricity producer’s Scope 1 emissions and our own Scope 2  emissions for electricity purchased to run our operations."
Conoco Phillips_1210,"We  are following the development of the Science Based Targets  Initiative methodology for the oil and gas industry and have  responded to their recent net-zero criteria consultation. We believe that the most practical way to avoid double- counting of emissions and overlap of targets is for all  companies to align with the Paris Agreement and set targets  for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Climate Policy to Address End-Use Demand   and Emissions  We have been clear since our first Climate Change Position  in 2003 that end-use emissions must be addressed to meet  global climate commitments. Climate policies along with  advances in technology and consumer choice will ultimately  drive demand and end-use emissions. We accept that in the  absence of full carbon capture and sequestration, demand  for energy must shift toward low-carbon and non-carbon  sources, so we take responsibility for encouraging that shift  by the most practical and effective means available – our  vocal support for carbon pricing that would cause a change  in the choices made by end users, detailed in the Public Policy  Engagement section."
Conoco Phillips_1215,"Our constructive advocacy for effective  carbon pricing policy began when we became the first U.S.  oil and gas company to join the United States Climate Action  Partnership in 2007 and continued in 2018 when we joined the  Climate Leadership Council as a founding member. It is also  reflected in the fact that our main industry associations have  now adopted positions on carbon pricing and other climate  policy that align with our public positions.REPORTING We have reported annually on Scope 3 emissions in our CDP  submissions since 2010 to acknowledge the role they play  in climate risk assessment. We calculate Scope 3 emissions  using the IPIECA 2016 Estimating Petroleum Industry Value  Chain (Scope 3) GHG Emissions guidance  based on net equity  production numbers. We report the four largest categories of  Scope 3 emissions that apply to our operations. For oil and natural gas exploration and production companies,  Scope 3 emissions fall primarily into the “use of sold products”  category."
Conoco Phillips_1220,"Though we do not control how our total production  is ultimately processed into consumer products, we make  the conservative assumption that the majority of production  is ultimately burned as fuel by end users. We use the API  Compendium GHG emissions factors for crude oil and natural  gas burned as fuel. This method accounts for all possible  GHG emissions that could be associated with end use of  our production. Our assumption and method are especially  conservative when the “double counting” issues inherent  in Scope 3 estimations for an exploration and production  company are taken into account. We conservatively calculate the other three categories of  Scope 3 emissions by taking our entire volume of crude  and natural gas and applying the relevant transportation,  distribution and processing emission factors from academic life  cycle analyses, including the 2019 National Energy Technology  Laboratory study: Life cycle analysis of natural gas extraction and  power generation ."

This can provide an environmental benefit through  reduced emissions, as well as an economic benefit through  lower production costs or greater sales revenue. Through  the natural decline of production, as our fields diminish in  size, they tend to require either the same, or in some cases,  even greater amounts of energy to extract the product and  transport it for processing or refining. Total energy consumption in 2021 was 220 trillion British  Thermal Units (BTUs)."
Conoco Phillips_1230,"Approximately 97% of our consumption  was combustion of fuel for our own energy use with the  remaining from purchased electricity. Low-Carbon Emitting Products  In 2021, we supplied Asian markets with approximately  0.5 trillion cubic feet (or 1.5 billion cubic feet per day) of  natural gas and LNG. To put this in perspective, if all the  natural gas and LNG we sold to Asia in 2021 had been used  to replace coal for electricity generation, GHG emissions  would have been reduced by approximately 38 million metric  tonnes, more than double the company’s combined Scope  1 and Scope 2 emissions for the year, based on EPA GHG  emissions factors.Water We manage water risks and mitigate potential impacts to  water resources, taking into account the unique hydrologic,  quality, use and ecological settings of each basin or offshore  marine area. Water risks are evolving globally in response to  cumulative effects of human water demand, physical effects  of climate change and changing priorities and expectations of  governments, investors and society. Water-related operational,  reputational and regulatory risks associated with fresh water  use, water stress, offshore produced water discharges and  onshore produced water disposal could affect our business."
Conoco Phillips_1235,"Read more about how we manage our water risks on our  website. We measure and report on the volume of fresh water and  non-fresh water withdrawn from local water sources and the  volume of produced water that is reused, recycled, disposed  or discharged after treatment. This data is used to estimate our  water intensity and exposure to water stress. We also collect  water forecast data for our Long-Range Plan which enables us  to test our portfolio of projects against our water risks to make  better-informed strategic decisions. The 2021 fresh water consumption intensity for our  unconventional assets in the U.S. (Eagle Ford, Delaware,  Midland and Bakken) and in Canada (Montney) was 0.08 bbl/ BOE EUR."

Our Anadarko,  Lost Cabin Gas Plant,⁶ Permian Midland Basin and Alaska  Kuparuk assets are located in basins with high or extremely  high baseline water stress and accounted for 17% of our  total fresh water withdrawal and 20% of our total fresh water  consumption in 2021. Fresh water accounts for about 12% of  source water used in the Midland Basin and is also used for  domestic purposes in staff camps, operational activities that  require wash water, and processing and drilling (e.g., for water- based drilling mud) where fresh water use is required."
Conoco Phillips_1245,"Measurement, Reporting   and Verification Measurement, reporting and verification of our climate  efforts and GHG data is critical for establishing credibility and  accountability around our targets. We have traditionally used  third-party verification for external, independent, limited  assurance of our GHG metrics. We also perform reasonable  assurance at select operated assets where it is required by  country-level regulation. Each of our BUs is responsible for quantifying emissions  and reporting the information to our corporate center for  compilation and internal quality assurance. Our GHG emissions  measurement methodologies use the rules, emission factors  and thresholds for regulatory emissions reporting with the  following amendments: We use a reporting threshold of  25,000 tonnes of CO₂e per year for an asset and/or emission  source category unless the regulatory reporting threshold  is lower."
Conoco Phillips_1250,"In our corporate reporting system, we include GHG  emissions based on direct sources of emissions (Scope 1  emissions) and indirect sources of emissions from imported  electricity and steam (Scope 2 emissions).The method of data collection at each individual source can  range from continuous emissions monitoring to emissions  estimations. Our estimating approaches meet applicable  regulatory reporting requirements or industry guidance,  as appropriate. The quality of estimating methodologies,  measurements and calculations is assessed internally by our  corporate Environmental Assurance group. We also report GHG emissions on an equity basis. GHG  emissions from non-operated assets are included for affiliated  companies and joint ventures in which ConocoPhillips owns  greater than or equal to 20% working interest or when our  share of GHG emissions (based on working interest) is greater  than or equal to 25,000 tonnes of CO₂e per year."

Effective Policy Climate change is a global issue which requires global  solutions. Economy-wide governmental GHG management  frameworks should be linked to binding international  agreements comprising the major GHG contributors."
Conoco Phillips_1335,"Effective  climate change policy requires a number of elements: Integrates energy and climate policy:  Climate change  policy and energy policy should be coordinated to ensure  a diverse and secure supply of affordable energy and avoid  overlapping or duplicating existing energy and climate change  programs. This must create a level competitive playing field  among energy sources and between countries and encourage  efficient use of energy.ConocoPhillips supports well-designed climate policy that  is practical, equitable and cost-effective in reducing GHG  emissions. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit  the rise of global average temperatures well below 2 degrees  Celsius which is reflected in our Paris-aligned ambition to be a  net-zero operational emissions company by 2050. Proactive Engagement Climate-related policy action can support an orderly transition  to a low-carbon economy, facilitate the development of  innovative technology and reduce the overall risks associated  with climate. We have been actively engaged in climate- related discussions with policy makers and stakeholders since  our first global climate change position was published in 2003."
Conoco Phillips_1340,"Our approach to public policy engagement on climate change  has evolved. However, we remain consistent in our view that  market-based solutions at national and global levels, rather  than a patchwork of less efficient regulatory approaches, will  be most effective in reducing GHG emissions. Among our efforts, ConocoPhillips is a founding member  of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international  policy institute founded in collaboration with business and  environmental interests to promote a carbon dividends  framework in the U.S. as the most cost-effective, equitable  and politically viable climate solution.

Carbon Pricing Demand-side emissions reduction efforts are required for  climate goals to be achieved, because supply-side constraints  alone would be ineffective in reducing global emissions. ConocoPhillips believes a well-designed pricing regime on  carbon emissions is the most effective tool to reduce GHG  emissions across the global economy. A revenue-neutral  carbon tax that is transparent, predictable and cost-effective to  administer would be an effective policy option."
Conoco Phillips_1370,"It should result  in some relief via the elimination of other laws and regulations  aimed at reducing or controlling carbon and other GHG  emissions. It is also the best way to regulate methane. Carbon  pricing policy should support the implementation of currently  economic emissions reduction projects and provide support  for innovation to encourage the development of currently  uneconomic projects. A price on carbon would also provide  a stable and predictable market signal that would impact  investment flows and end-user choices in a manner that  minimizes adverse local economic and social impacts of an  energy transition. We advocate for carbon pricing directly through engagement  with government legislators and regulators in all jurisdictions  in which we operate, and indirectly via collaboration with  trade associations that are aligned with our strategy."

We support and are advocating  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 77 Climate Public Policy Engagementfor a carbon price contingent upon four pillars: a gradually  increasing carbon price, carbon dividends for all Americans,  border carbon adjustments and regulatory simplification."
Conoco Phillips_1380,"We have been actively engaged in climate-related discussions  with policy makers and stakeholders since our first global  climate change position  was published in 2003. Since then,  we have developed Climate Change Action Plans , set an  emissions intensity target , integrated carbon restricted  scenarios  into our strategic planning process and published  carbon tax principles. Global Principles for Country-Specific  Carbon Tax Legislation A well-designed carbon tax or other legislative proposal to fix  and impose a price on carbon dioxide or other GHGs should  meet the following principles:   ŰEconomy-wide:  A carbon tax designed to fix and  impose a price should apply as broadly across the  economy as administratively practicable. ŰNon-discriminatory:  GHG emissions alone should  form the basis of taxation. A carbon tax should not  “pick winners and losers” among industries or emissions  sources or discriminate in providing subsidies to energy  sources."
Conoco Phillips_1385,"ŰUniform:  A carbon tax should apply to all GHG  emissions at the same rate on a “units of carbon dioxide  equivalent” basis using the IPCC standard 100-year global  warming potential. ŰTransparent:  To most efficiently incentivize changes  to consumer behavior, a carbon tax should be imposed  at the point in the value chain which is as close as  administratively practicable to the point and timing  of the emission. If a point is chosen further upstream,  a system of credits or other mechanisms should be  designed to eliminate (or prevent) taxation of emissions  applicable to taxable products sequestered downstream  of the point of taxation and to those used as feedstocks  for the manufacture of products in which GHGs are  stored. ŰAvoid double taxation:  A federal carbon tax should  preempt state, provincial and local carbon taxes and  renewable production tax credits. ŰProvide regulatory relief:  A federal carbon tax should  replace all environmental laws and regulations that are  intended to reduce or control carbon and other GHG  emissions."
Conoco Phillips_1390,"ŰPredictable:  The application of a carbon tax and the  tax rate may be adjustable when necessary, but such  adjustments should be infrequent and should be limited  to those designed to achieve the broader environmental  goal of the tax legislation. ŰCost-effective administration:  Existing channels of  tax collection and emissions reporting systems should  be used if feasible. Where actual emissions cannot be  measured, best efforts based upon sound science should  be used as an estimate. ŰGlobally competitive:  A country-specific carbon tax  rate should be set in accordance with existing taxation  channels and emissions reporting systems and be  adjusted to ensure global competitiveness. Depending  on the point of taxation chosen, carbon tax legislation  should include a border adjustment mechanism, or  other attributes designed to mitigate competitive  disadvantages to host country industry when competing  in global markets."
Conoco Phillips_1395,"ŰRevenue recycling:  A carbon tax should be revenue- neutral and used in such a way as to minimize economic  impact. ŰCompliance flexibility:  A federal carbon tax should  include multiple options for compliance, including  offset credits from a broad range of jurisdictions, cash  payments or flexible compliance frequency. History of Engagement Our approach to public policy engagement on climate change  has evolved. However, we remain consistent in our view that  market-based solutions at national and global levels, rather  than a patchwork of less effective regulatory approaches, are  most likely to be effective in reducing GHG emissions. Shortly after the merger of Conoco and Phillips Petroleum in  2003, we published our first global climate change position."
Conoco Phillips_1400,"Since then, we have consistently used our Sustainability Report  to detail our commitments, priorities and actions. We have  also participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (now CDP)  questionnaire since 2003. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 78 Climate Public Policy EngagementHistorical Engagement In 2004, we described actions that we would be taking to  address climate change, including:   ŰAssessing data. ŰDeveloping objectives to reduce GHG emissions. ŰImproving operational efficiency."
Conoco Phillips_1405,"ŰDeveloping climate change considerations for project  planning and approval processes. ŰEngaging in discussions on climate change through  the International Petroleum Industry Environmental  Conservation Association (now IPIECA). ŰJoining the International Emissions Trading Association  (IETA). In 2005, we began trading in the European Union ETS. Through our membership in the U.S."
Conoco Phillips_1410,"Climate Action  Partnership  (USCAP) beginning in 2007 , we actively  participated in efforts to design an effective legislative  approach. In 2008, we adopted and published our first Climate Change  Action Plan to systematically address climate change risk. In June 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security Act  of 2009 (HR2454) (Waxman-Markey) bill passed the House  of Representatives. Although the USCAP Blueprint for  Legislative Action was considered influential in the design  of the legislation, we  had serious concerns  about some of  the detailed elements in the bill. Following passage of the  House bill, our focus turned to addressing issues of concern  in the Senate version of the legislation."
Conoco Phillips_1415,"In order to intensify  our company’s focus and resources on addressing the key  issues, including the important role that natural gas can play in  reducing U.S. GHG emissions, we announced in February 2010  that the company would not be renewing our membership  in USCAP . Through this more direct engagement, we were successful  in helping to develop draft legislation that incorporated a  more equitable approach to energy sectors while maintaining  environmental effectiveness. We issued a statement  regarding  the draft legislation introduced in the Senate in May 2010.Since 2010, we’ve continued to work toward approaches that  are practical and effective, including active participation in  dialogue with trade associations like the American Petroleum  Institute (API), industry partners and the government to  advocate smart policy solutions. In 2021, we made the decision to rejoin IETA to further our  advocacy for market solutions to the climate challenge. IETA is a non-profit business organization created in 1999 to  establish a functional international framework for trading in  GHG emissions reductions."
Conoco Phillips_1420,"IETA members seek to develop an  emissions trading regime that results in real and verifiable GHG  emissions reductions, while balancing economic efficiency  with environmental integrity and social equity. IETA is a  global carbon policy organization, and they support carbon  offset trading systems. Their membership includes leading  international companies from across the carbon trading cycle. IETA have a seat on the Task Force for Scaling Voluntary Carbon  Markets (TSVCM). Examples of Regulatory Engagement  Collaborating with a broad range of stakeholders on effective  climate change policy and GHG emissions solutions is key to  solving the climate change challenge."
Conoco Phillips_1425,"In 2014, we publicly supported the Gas Capture Plan in North  Dakota, now required, which took a pro-active approach to  flare gas reduction. We entered into agreements with pipeline  companies to ensure that required gathering infrastructure  was available when needed in order to reduce emissions. In 2016, we supported the U.S. Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) Onshore Order 1, electronic filings, as the proposed  changes reduced work and errors and sped up response time  for both industry and the government. In 2016, the BLM proposed a series of Onshore Orders. After  careful review, ConocoPhillips opposed Onshore Order 9, the  proposed Venting and Flaring rule, based on the conclusion  that the BLM was overreaching their authority and the  proposal created a duplication of federal authority with EPA."
Conoco Phillips_1430,"Our comments to the BLM included suggestions to remove  many of the duplicative requirements. While we opposed  many of the requirements in Onshore Order 9, we did suggest  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 79 Climate Public Policy Engagementsome changes to certain proposed requirements. For example,  we agreed that the limits for royalty-free flaring should be  changed and gave recommendations for the limits. Directly and through our trades we have worked to advance  the development and deployment of carbon capture,  utilization and storage to achieve a cleaner energy profile and  improve U.S. economic security. In 2018, Congress passed  the Furthering Carbon Capture, Utilization, Technology,  Underground Storage, and Reduced Emissions Act to enhance  the 45Q tax credit to further incentivize carbon capture and  storage technology deployment in the United States."
Conoco Phillips_1435,"The  primary issue with the 45Q tax credit is the interpretation of  what constitutes secure geological storage (SGS). In particular,  we support the adoption of a commercially reasonable ISO  standard to demonstrate secure geological storage in the  context of captured carbon dioxide that gets sequestered  underground for enhanced oil recovery projects. The standard  should establish criteria for transparency and assurance that  carbon dioxide removal is achieved. We also support self- verification of compliance with the ISO standard given that our  tax officer would attest to satisfying the requirements of 45Q  under penalties of perjury. Recent Legislative Engagement  In 2019, we worked within the broad coalition of Climate  Leadership Council (CLC) members to better define details  of the overarching implementation plan."

While  the policy work continues with CLC members, the results of  that engagement are reflected in the more detailed CLC plan   released in early 2020. We also engaged with members of  Congress directly and through Americans for Carbon Dividends. This included reviewing several proposed climate bills and  continuing to offer technical feedback on those bills to elected  representatives and their staff.

Conoco Phillips_1445,"In 2022, ConocoPhillips Joined the Oil Sands Pathways to  Net-Zero alliance, which includes Canadian Natural Resources,  Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy. Together this group represents the companies operating  approximately 95% of Canada’s oil sands production. The goal  of the alliance is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from oil  sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals,  including the country’s Paris Agreement commitments and  2050 net-zero aspirations. ConocoPhillips is partnering with the  founding members of the Pathways Alliance and governments  to accelerate efforts to bring about meaningful change. Association Engagement Many trade organizations we participate in have climate  change positions aligned to ours."
Conoco Phillips_1450,"Where they do not, we have  continued to offer our viewpoint and attempt to work with  them to better align their position with ours. For example,  we’ve worked to influence the American Petroleum Institute  (API), the Business Roundtable (BRT) and other organizations  to support the direct federal regulation of methane. In  addition to actively participating in trade organization  position updates, we have also voted against or abstained  from supporting specific actions requested by a trade  organization if their positions were not aligned with ours. We  have also decided not to renew some memberships because  of misalignment on a number of policy topics, one of which is  climate change. For more information about our governance  and major trade associations please see Political Support  Policies and Procedures  on our website ."
Conoco Phillips_1455,"With our history of constructive engagement related to  the issue of end-use emissions, we continue to devote  significant time and effort engaging and advocating for  a well-designed federal price on carbon, including within  our trade associations. We believe a price on carbon is the  most effective, equitable method to reduce GHG emissions,  including methane, across the economy. To advance this  position, ConocoPhillips joined the Climate Leadership  Council (CLC) in 2019 as a Founding Member along with the  CLC’s advocacy organization, Americans for Carbon Dividends  (AFCD), which is focused on progressing the Baker-Shultz  Carbon Dividends plan; since then, our Executive Leadership  Team and Government Affairs staff have participated in well  over 100 bipartisan meetings with members of Congress  and the Administration. Our consistent, strong engagement  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 80 Climate Public Policy Engagementwith our major trade associations, including the American  Petroleum Institute, the Business Roundtable and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, has influenced their climate policy  positions to include support for a market-based approach  to GHG emissions.

Conoco Phillips_1460,"Participation in the CPLC  further demonstrates our commitment to carbon pricing  and is complementary to our engagement with the Climate  Leadership Council. As part of our routine review of trade association membership,  the company evaluates how trade organization policy  positions align with those expressed by ConocoPhillips,  including:   ŰParis Agreement:  The company’s GHG emissions  reduction targets and actions are consistent with  the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit the rise of global  temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius. In  measuring alignment, we considered policies which  support the goals of the Paris Agreement as aligned with  our own. ŰCarbon Pricing:  A well-designed pricing regime on  carbon emissions is the most effective tool to reduce  GHG emissions across the global economy. Carbon  pricing policy should support the implementation of  currently economic emissions reduction projects and  provide support for R&D to encourage the development  technology for currently uneconomic projects."
Conoco Phillips_1465,"A revenue-neutral carbon tax that is transparent,  predictable and cost-effective to administer would be an  effective policy option. It should result in some relief via  the elimination of other laws and regulations aimed at  reducing or controlling carbon and other GHG emissions. In measuring alignment, we considered policies which  support a market-based mechanism to reduce GHG  emissions across the economy as aligned with our own. ŰAddressing Methane Emissions:  The most effective  tool for emissions reductions across the economy would  be a well-designed federal pricing regime on carbon  emissions. In the absence of a carbon pricing policy, we  support enactment of cost-effective federal methane  regulations on new and existing sources that would  preserve a state’s ability to adapt implementation to  local conditions."

The effort aims to  reduce steam-oil ratio (SOR) and greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions intensity and initial results from the effort  are promising, decreasing SOR while increasing oil  production. “This steam additives pilot is one incremental technology  that will help us optimize the SAGD process by reducing  the steam-oil ratio,” noted Javier Sanchez, Supervisor,  Technology, ConocoPhillips Canada. “The effort is  helping us build a pathway to net-zero.”OPTIMIZING PRODUCTION During SAGD, additives are co-injected with steam,  where they do their work at the edge of the steam  chamber (condensation layer), increasing the  emulsification of oil in water and reducing its viscosity."
Conoco Phillips_1475,"This improves fluid drainage and oil recovery per unit  of steam injected, lowering both SOR and the amount  of energy used for production. Depending on the type  of energy source (electric or natural gas), this translates  into a lower carbon footprint per barrel of oil as well as  a lower water recirculation rate, which minimizes the  use of fresh water.

ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 89 Water Governance and Strategyfacilitated using centralized water gathering and distribution  systems with strategically located recycling facilities. Water  infrastructure is a key component of these gathering systems. Virtually none of our source water is transported via truck,  and more than 90% of produced water used in our Permian  operations is transported via pipeline. To minimize reliance on local fresh water sources and because  some of our Permian assets are located in areas with high  baseline water stress, we actively pursue opportunities to  use recycled produced water to frack new wells."
Conoco Phillips_1585,"We have  established partnerships  with third-party midstream  providers for our Midland  and Delaware assets for  services including water  supply and delivery, pipeline  design and operation,  waste water disposal, and  produced water treatment. In 2021, 10 produced water  recycling facilities treated  water from our own natural  gas and oil wells. We also work with third parties to source  additional recycled produced water. Our engineered storage  pits for treated produced water are double-lined and have  leak detection systems, and storage pits and disposal facilities  are also equipped with remote monitoring devices. In 2021,  52% of the water used for hydraulic fracturing of new wells  in Delaware and 55% of water used in Midland was recycled  produced water."
Conoco Phillips_1590,"In addition to recycled produced water, we have been using  reclaimed municipal waste water for our Midland assets  since 2015. This reclaimed waste water is sourced from  municipalities and other third parties and treated in the  hydraulic fracture process. In Canada’s Montney development, we also manage water  using a centralized water gathering and distribution system. Produced water from operating wells is treated for recycling,  stored in engineered ponds and then used to complete the  next well. In 2021, over 98% of the water used for fracking was  recycled produced water due to reduced drilling activity."
Conoco Phillips_1595,"As  more wells are completed in future development phases, we  will reduce the volume of fresh water withdrawn from the Risk Management  Water sourcing and produced water management are global  challenges that require local solutions. Local water risks  are characterized by the combination of social, regulatory,  economic and environmental conditions, which are unique to  every basin or offshore marine area. Risks are influenced by the  type of operation – whether we explore for or produce crude  oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids or liquefied natural  gas – and whether we operate an unconventional reservoir or  within a conventional field onshore or offshore. Water risks are  managed at the BU level, enabling a tailored region-specific  approach. Our water sources include fresh, non-fresh and reused/ recycled produced water used for drilling, enhanced oil  recovery (EOR), hydraulic fracturing, steam generation for  steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) oil sands production,  natural gas and oil terminals, LNG production and domestic  purposes."
Conoco Phillips_1600,"Produced water from our onshore operations is treated and  recycled to hydraulically fracture wells and generate SAGD  steam, reused untreated for EOR, or disposed by well injection. Produced water from offshore operations is treated prior to  discharge from offshore platforms in accordance with local  regulations. We also manage waste water at our terminals,  for LNG production and domestic waste water for staff  accommodations at remote assets. Unconventional In 2021, our unconventional assets included Eagle Ford,  Delaware and Midland Basins in the Permian and Bakken in the  U.S. and Montney in Canada. Recycled produced water has been identified as the best  option to source hydraulic fracturing operations for our  Delaware, Midland and Montney assets."
Conoco Phillips_1605,"This recycling has  both economic and environmental benefits as the use of  recycled produced water reduces both the amount of water  withdrawn from local sources and the amount of produced  water injected for disposal. Our Delaware and Midland unconventional assets are part  of the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New  Mexico.

Conoco Phillips_1610,"Due to a  delay in the development  schedule and reduced drilling  activity for 2021 we had a  surplus of produced water. We turned this challenge into  an opportunity by sharing  our treated produced water  with other local operators,  recycling an additional 10%  of our total produced water recovered. In turn, we are planning  to receive produced water from other local operators to utilize  excess capacity at our water treatment facility in 2022. We will  use treated third-party produced water to reduce our fresh  water use in 2022 and beyond. Learn more about our Montney  water management  on our website ."
Conoco Phillips_1615,"In Texas’s Eagle Ford, we target groundwater sources that  are not in close proximity to local municipal, domestic or  agricultural users. In support of this goal, we progressed our  deep water well project in Karnes County. Deeper wells are  more likely to be  brackish, helping us to  boost the volume of  non-fresh water used  for operations. Source  water for drilling  and completions is  transported using  temporary, lay-flat  pipelines from central  storage ponds, rather  than trucks. In 2021, we  expanded additional  water connections between existing central gathering and  disposal systems and central storage ponds in DeWitt and  Karnes counties."
Conoco Phillips_1620,"We also began the installation of a pipeline- based produced water central gathering and disposal system  for new facilities in Sugarloaf, located in Live Oak County. The  central water facility is scheduled to be commissioned in 2022  These initiatives have further reduced truck traffic on local  roads. In 2021, about 67% of the water sourced for operations  in the Eagle Ford was non-fresh water. For our Bakken operations, water is predominately sourced  from local surface and groundwater which is largely  transported using temporary, lay-flat pipelines from central  storage ponds and underground water distribution systems. Most of produced water is transferred to disposal wells using  pipeline infrastructure."
Conoco Phillips_1625,"In 2021, about 35% of the water sourced  for operations in the Bakken was non-fresh water. Induced Seismicity We have our own Global Induced Seismicity Guidelines  to understand and mitigate potential seismicity related to  fracking and produced water injection disposal wells. We  evaluate third-party disposal wells by conducting a seismic  hazard risk assessment prior to selecting third-party disposal  wells for use. We utilize a range of real-time seismic monitoring networks,  including the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, United States  Geological Survey and Nanometrics  (a commercial monitoring  entity), that enables us to make immediate evaluations and  engage in mitigating actions if required. Our protocols reflect  variations in local regulatory frameworks."
Conoco Phillips_1630,"In 2021, we supported research led by the University of Texas  at Austin’s multi-disciplinary Center for Integrated Seismicity  Research (CISR) to understand seismicity across Texas. Together  with industry partners, we helped fund the research that  uses TexNet seismic monitoring data to conduct this analysis. TexNet is a system of earthquake sensors placed in the ground  at over one hundred locations across the state of Texas. TexNet  data is publicly available and widely used by academics. We work to reduce the likelihood of induced seismicity events  through internal seismic reviews before starting operations  and through ongoing engagement with state regulators and  other stakeholders."
Conoco Phillips_1635,"In 2021, two seismic response areas (SRA) were implemented in  the Permian Basin by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC),  the state agency that regulates the oil and gas industry, in  response to increased seismicity. The RRC has recommended  reduced disposal injection volumes within these areas. We  modify our disposal practices to remain consistent with the  RRC’s guidance.We target  groundwater  sources that are not  in close proximity  to local municipal,  domestic or  agricultural users in  the Eagle Ford.OUR TARGET:  Recycle at least  80%  of the produced  water for fracking  in the Montney  Basin. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 91 Risk Management Water Conventional Our diverse operated conventional asset portfolio includes  Alaska’s Kuparuk and Alpine fields and the Permian Basin in  the U.S. Water management for our Alaska operations is unique, as  most of our fresh water use is not directly for natural gas and oil  production, but primarily to build seasonal ice roads and pads  for exploration and overland resupply. The water is sourced  locally from surface water bodies in accordance with regulatory  permits and returned to the environment every spring as  meltwater."
Conoco Phillips_1640,"Less than 1% of total water use is fresh water  for drilling to produce natural gas and oil. For enhanced oil  recovery (EOR) operations, our Alaska assets rely on non-fresh  water, specifically seawater, and reused produced water. For our conventional assets in the Permian Basin we are  reusing produced water for EOR. Fresh water is primarily used  for operational activities that require wash water and for  processing and drilling (such as for water-based drilling mud). LNG Facilities Water management priorities for our Australia-Pacific LNG  (APLNG) facility focus on the quality of water discharged  to municipal water treatment systems or directed to  the receiving environment."

In 2021, we implemented  projects to reduce fresh water use at the APLNG facility by  approximately 25%. Read more about our water management  at APLNG  on our website . Oil Sands In Canada, steam-assisted bitumen recovery at our Surmont  oil sands operation is primarily supported by recycled  produced water with supplements from a mix of groundwater  supply wells classified as low-quality non-saline and saline  by Alberta regulators."
Conoco Phillips_1650,"These impaired quality water supplies  are not suitable for domestic or agricultural use with  standard treatment technologies and are located at sufficient depth to be isolated from surface water and interactions  with aquatic ecosystems. Water management priorities for  Surmont include maximizing the efficiency of the water cycle  and reducing the steam-oil ratio associated with bitumen  production. As a founding member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation  Alliance  (COSIA) we are committed to the in situ oil sands  performance goal  to reduce fresh water use intensity by 50%,  from a 2012 benchmark, by 2022. To date, the fresh water  use intensity has been reduced by about 47% collectively by  COSIA companies.

Our ambition is to maintain these  low oil-in-water ratios. Efficient water treatment to reduce oil-in-water concentrations  also reduces the level of other discharged components that  may impact the marine environment."
Conoco Phillips_1665,"Potential impacts from  produced water being discharged into the sea have been  monitored and assessed for more than 20 years, including in  situ water column monitoring. Based on current knowledge,  the environmental risk of discharging produced water is very  low.

Conoco Phillips_1705,Gladstone Harbor  and Marina. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 97 Water External CollaborationSmart Water Use   in the Permian Basin SPOTLIGHT ConocoPhillips’ 2021 acquisition of Concho Resources’  Midland and Delaware Basin assets and of Shell’s Delaware  Basin position significantly expanded our operations in  the Permian region. Much of the Permian Basin is either  characterized as arid or as experiencing high baseline  water stress. The challenge is especially notable in two  areas – our Delaware and Midland unconventional assets. Expansion of our operations in these arid or water-stressed  regions in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico  heightened our need to minimize the use of fresh water  for drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
Conoco Phillips_1710,"During oil and gas production in the Permian, we  produce up to seven times more water than oil, a unique  characteristic in our unconventional portfolio. One of  our overarching goals is to maximize produced water  recycling across the basin, enabling us to minimize our  reliance on local fresh water sources. We make use of  produced water – water that returns to the surface during  production – that is then treated and stored. The treated  water, about 22% of the total produced water recovered  in 2021, remains in double-lined, engineered storage pits  until needed for use in hydraulically fracturing, or fracking,  new wells. As a result, we are reducing both the amount  of water withdrawn from local sources and the amount  of produced water injected for disposal."
Conoco Phillips_1715,"This process  minimizes water-related risks while offering environmental  and economic benefits. “The integration of the new assets into our Permian  operations gave us the opportunity to optimize our  produced water recycling operations and make an even greater impact through our increased operational  footprint,” said Permian Water Resource Manager Lauren  Sloan Louderback. “We achieved this by building on our  established successes and track record and incorporating  the best practices of each company to advance our  recycling efforts.” The integration of assets magnified produced water  recycling tenfold in 2021. Ten produced water recycling  facilities treated water from our own natural gas and oil  wells. Overall, 52% of water used for hydraulically fracturing  new wells in Delaware and 55% of water used in Midland  was recycled produced water."
Conoco Phillips_1720,"The overall water management performance of  heritage Concho assets helped improve the company’s  unconventional fresh water consumption intensity by a  factor of three, making our water use more efficient. Simply  put, we used three times less fresh water to produce the  same amount of oil and gas. “Our goal is to maximize recycling across the Permian, and  recycled produced water is our number one choice in  water sourcing. For each hydraulic fracturing operation,  we develop a smart, safe water sourcing strategy. During  this process, we identify limitations to recycling and work  together to tackle those challenges to continue increasing  recycled produced water and delivering on our promises."
Conoco Phillips_1725,"Over the past couple of years, we have recycled enough  produced water to replace an entire year’s worth of frack  water demand with 100% recycled produced water,”  Louderback said. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 98 Water SpotlightWATER INFRASTRUCTURE Water infrastructure is a key enabler of recycling produced  water. The infrastructure includes pipelines and treatment  facilities linking well sites to a centralized system. Virtually  none of our source water is transported via truck and  more than 90% of produced water used in our Permian  operations is transported via pipeline. The remainder of  the produced water is transported by truck."
Conoco Phillips_1730,"We also have established partnerships with third-party  midstream providers in our Midland and Delaware  assets for services including water supply and delivery,  pipeline design and operation, and wastewater disposal  and produced water treatment. These key strategic  partnerships and agreements allow for a significant increase in recycled produced water volumes that not  only benefit our company, but also the industry and the  communities where we operate. Findings from produced water management efforts in the  Permian Basin are shared across ConocoPhillips business  units for replication where appropriate. These lessons  learned in the Permian, Louderback said, are being used in  other areas. “Sharing how we are addressing these challenges using  our technical and operational expertise is important – our  water recycling program not only offers environmental  benefits but also lowers our cost of supply,” Louderback  noted."

The Surmont Boreal Reclamation Project, a research initiative  with the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology’s Centre for  Boreal Research, is an example of progressive reclamation. The  research focuses on the use of alternative site preparation and  planting native plant species to establish forest vegetation on  soil stockpiles decades in advance of final reclamation. The soil stockpile for our Surmont Regional Residence covers  an area of about 25 acres and will remain in place for decades. Initial research data from plant surveys indicate that the  alternative site preparation and revegetation with native plant  species reduce erosion, contribute to increasing plant and  animal biodiversity, significantly reduce the relative abundance  of undesirable weed species and improve the amount and  quality of reclamation material for final reclamation."

In 2012, ICF adopted an adaptive wetland  management plan for the Momoge and Xianghai National  Nature Reserves of the Songnen Plain. Working together  with experts and nature reserve staff in China, they tailored  the most up to date wetland zoning management with  local requirements. Dr. Jiang Hongxing from the National  Bird Banding Center of China said, “through adaptive and  dynamic management of the Siberian Crane migratory  stopover areas, the quality and resilience of these habitats  are maintained, which ensures the migratory safety and  reproductive development of the species.” Environmental education remains at the forefront of crane  conservation efforts and raising public awareness among  local communities in China is critical for crane survival."

Photography by ICF ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 115 Biodiversity SpotlightSPOTLIGHT Monitoring Caribou on  Alaska’s North Slope On Alaska’s North Slope, caribou are one of the  primary sources of food for Indigenous Peoples. So  it’s only natural that the potential impacts of oilfield  development on caribou abundance and distribution is  of interest to North Slope residents. ConocoPhillips has  been monitoring caribou movement and distribution  in our areas of interest on the North Slope for decades. We also partner with the North Slope Borough and the  Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) to collect  data about caribou movement and migration."
Conoco Phillips_2000,"Data  gained through this collaborative work informs science,  engineering design and best practices for operations  and new project development. To monitor the movement of the two primary caribou  herds, ConocoPhillips Alaska funds the purchase of  radio telemetry collars and works with the ADF&G to  place them on caribou. Using the data from the collars,  individual animals are tracked to assess if their seasonal  movement may be influenced by factors including  oilfield activities, snow levels, vegetation, terrain, insect  harassment or proximity to the coast. The shared data  provides detailed information on which areas caribou  use consistently during different seasons year-over-year,  Caribou at CD-1.how those areas correspond with proposed development, and if  movement patterns change after construction. “Simply put, it helps give us the big picture – shows us where  the herds are moving and how they’re doing."
Conoco Phillips_2005,"Knowing this  helps inform infrastructure decisions,” said Senior Environmental  Coordinator for Biological Sciences Christina Pohl. There are  “tens of thousands in each herd.” “Understanding how to coexist with the caribou is one of our top  priorities,” Pohl continued. “By using science to inform operational  decisions that may impact caribou or other animals we can best  ensure that our activities don’t interfere with the animals.” Throughout the years, ConocoPhillips Alaska has improved  oilfield facility design to accommodate caribou and developed  best practices for operations to reduce potential for impacts. There is now a minimum spacing requirement between roads  and pipelines, coating on new pipelines to reduce shine or  glare, and speed limit restrictions. Pipelines are installed at least  seven feet off the ground to allow the caribou easy passage  underneath."
Conoco Phillips_2010,"Infrastructure placement may also be influenced by the collected  data, including where drill sites are located and the height, shape  ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 116 Biodiversity Spotlightand location of roads. One study focus area in 2021 was  the Bear Tooth Unit, which includes the proposed Willow  development and a region to the south. Most caribou in  this area are from the Teshekpuk Herd, which has significant  numbers of the herd remaining on the Coastal Plain during  winter, in contrast to the Central Arctic herd in the Kuparuk  and Prudhoe Bay areas, which mostly migrate further south  for the winter. Although caribou distribution and movements  vary widely by season, most calving of the Teshekpuk herd  occurs near Teshekpuk Lake, over 20 miles from the proposed  development area. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) Integrated  Activity Plan requires caribou studies prior to construction to  understand how caribou use the area."
Conoco Phillips_2015,"Researchers in other studies noted that the area north  of Teshekpuk Lake is a popular area for caribou to escape  mosquito harassment. Caribou monitoring and subsistence  harvest studies will continue throughout the proposed  Willow project’s lifetime to inform continued caribou  protection practices. ConocoPhillips began monitoring caribou movement and  distribution in the Kuparuk area in the late 1970s, including  aerial surveys in the area from 1993 to 2017. In 2021, we  continued annual monitoring to assess the Central Arctic  Herd near our Kuparuk and nearby Alpine oilfields. 2021  data indicated that the herd moved through the oilfields  repeatedly during early and midsummer and some large groups were on the Colville River Delta in June and July."
Conoco Phillips_2020,"The results were generally consistent with previous studies  in the area showing different behaviors and response to  oilfields during different seasons. For example, during the  calving period of about two weeks in early June, caribou  tended to avoid roads and pads, but the avoidance declined  significantly after calving. In late June and early July, caribou  moved rapidly through the oilfields and crossed roads to  reach coastal mosquito-relief habitat directly. In late July and  early August, many caribou favored gravel roads and pads to  avoid harassment by oestrid flies, before they started their fall  migration into the Brooks Range. SIGNIFICANCE TO HUNTERS A healthy and stable caribou population is important to  communities on the North Slope and their subsistence  lifestyle."
Conoco Phillips_2025,"In addition to monitoring the caribou, ConocoPhillips  has sponsored a Caribou Subsistence Monitoring Study  in Nuiqsut for the past 14 years. This study showed that  subsistence harvests remain strong and that a sizable number  of hunters are utilizing the Alpine and Greater Mooses Tooth  roads to improve hunting access. The study also provides  information about how to improve our operations, such as  coordinating helicopters to avoid hunters, and designing  subsistence pullouts and ramps in appropriate locations and  configurations for access to the tundra. “Our goal is for our operations to not disrupt either the  animals or the hunters,” Pohl said.Pipelines on the North Slope are installed at least seven feet off the  ground to allow the caribou easy passage underneath.

Conoco Phillips_2085,"This allows us to better  manage potential risks and impacts to local stakeholders and  our business while supporting mutually beneficial relationships  and creating long term value. In 2021, we continued with our Social and Stakeholder  Engagement Issues Working Group (IWG) quarterly calls. The  IWG seeks to provide a platform for knowledge sharing on  best practices, as well as to track emerging topics and monitor  the progress of the different business units regarding their  engagement with communities and other key stakeholders. We identified Just Transition as an emerging issue becoming  increasingly important to stakeholders. The Paris Agreement  notes the imperatives of a Just Transition of the workforce and  the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance  with nationally defined development priorities."
Conoco Phillips_2090,"To better  understand the implications in the context of our path to  net-zero, we created a multidisciplinary task force. Listening and Integrating Stakeholder  Input into Business Decisions As we gain further understanding about stakeholders’ values,  priorities and concerns, we seek to integrate their input into  our plans and operations. Through inclusive and transparent  engagement, we work with stakeholders to find mutually  beneficial solutions that address the impacts of our operations  on their communities. ALASKA In Alaska, we have frequent engagements with communities  located closest to our operations from community meetings,  open houses, and reports to state and local organizations. For our proposed Willow project in the National Petroleum  Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), there has been extensive public involvement including more than 40 days of public comment  and 13 in-person public meetings in Anchorage, Fairbanks,  Nuiqsut, Utqiagvik, Atqasuk, and Anaktuvuk Pass since the  Environmental Impact Statement process commenced in 2018."
Conoco Phillips_2095,"In response to comments and feedback collected from our  stakeholders about our proposed Willow project, a proposed  offshore gravel island was eliminated, and a land-based ice  road module transportation route was adopted. Speed limits  and road width have been reduced to minimize potential  caribou impacts. An important focus of our engagement was facilitating and  improving subsistence access including:   ŰFull access to all new Willow roads for nearby residents. ŰProposed new boat ramps to improve subsistence access  to key rivers. ŰProposed subsistence road ramps and pullouts every  2-3 miles to improve hunter access from new roads."
Conoco Phillips_2100,"For the past decade, we’ve met regularly with subsistence  representatives from areas near our operations to discuss  planned helicopter and small aircraft operations as well as  locations of hunting and gathering activities to ensure our  operations don’t interfere with the subsistence lifestyle of  our neighbors. Those virtual discussions led us to postpone  all flights for a week during caribou migration at the request  of Nuiqsut Village representatives.

Based around the  core pillars of relationships, respect and opportunities, our  RAP provides tangible actions and meaningful steps to  advance reconciliation in Australia with Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander peoples, increasing economic equity and  supporting First Nations self-determination. Our RAP guides  us to strategically set reconciliation commitments in line  with our business objectives and was formally endorsed by  Reconciliation Australia in late 2021. CANADA In Canada, Indigenous Peoples (who consist of First Nations,  Métis and Inuit) have legally protected rights within their  traditional territories. Due to the close proximity of Indigenous  communities to our Canadian operations, we have developed  a values and interest assessment (VIA) process to guide our  relationships with those communities to create positive,  sustainable outcomes."
Conoco Phillips_2115,"The VIA process starts with our External  Relations team building relationships through authentic,  collaborative dialogue with members of the community. Next,  we work with the community to create a shared vision and to  discuss ways we can work together. The third stage centers  around planning and focuses on collaboratively prioritizing  ideas and creating structures and processes for working  together.

In Northeast British Columbia, we continue to work with local  communities as we develop our Montney project. We have  a “life of project” Relationship Agreement with the Halfway  River First Nation (HRFN) that supports collaborative processes  around community engagement and contracting. HRFN  and ConocoPhillips worked together in 2021 to broaden our  existing pre-engagement approach."
Conoco Phillips_2125,"This included planning,  review and discussion of surface pad site area (SPA) options  to be used during the 3-to-4-year development of the  project. A review of possible options within the Montney  acreage was overlaid with HRFN’s Land Information System,  improving awareness for both parties. This exercise provided  an opportunity to build HRFN knowledge and values into  the overall development plan, both in the short and long  term. As the process funneled toward project-specific sites,  pre-engagement continued to be key, including joint field  review and discussion.

Conoco Phillips_2290,"This tower will connect  multiple response agencies and allow them to better  serve community members in their most vulnerable  moments,” added Chloe Desjardins, advisor, Permian  Stakeholder Relations. The company provided $123,000  for constructing the tower, which will support the  PBRPC’s 9-1-1 Emergency Department and bring radio First responders demonstrate  equipment used to pry open car doors  after accidents.

People in the area can experience extremely unreliable  cellular connectivity, a challenge that is amplified during  emergencies."
Conoco Phillips_2295,"“We take our role in the community very seriously,” said  ConocoPhillips’ Permian President Jack Harper. “We are  grateful for the work local organizations do every day to  address the specific needs of west Texas, southeast New  Mexico and the surrounding areas.” LIFE-SAVING EQUIPMENT Accidents in rural areas pose multiple challenges and first  responders often do not have the best equipment to quickly  address emergency situations. We partnered with the  Permian Strategic Partnership  (PSP), Permian Road Safety  Coalition  (PRSC) and industry peers to provide a $1.1 million  donation to the “First Responder Life-Saving Equipment  Initiative.” This will provide life-saving equipment for first  responders in 22 counties across west Texas and southeast  New Mexico. Funds were used for emergency equipment  such as battery-powered “jaws of life” to free people trapped  in vehicles, fire extinguishers, mobile lighting tools and  rescue helicopter landing zone kits. First responders also  received gloves, face shields, gas detection meters and calibration tools."
Conoco Phillips_2300,"Each set of emergency response equipment  is valued at approximately $20,000. “This collaborative effort will ultimately save lives, and we are  proud to help provide critical tools to our first responders that  will enable their on-scene response in the most remote areas  of the Permian Basin,” said Vanessa Rawlins, a PRSC Board Chair  and ConocoPhillips Lower 48 HSE Manager. The partnership with PSP expands an initial PRSC investment  of more than $250,000 in donated equipment that began in  early 2020. The PSP is a coalition of energy companies working together  to improve the quality of life in the region through education,  road safety, healthcare, housing and workforce development. ConocoPhillips has been involved with the PSP since its  creation in 2018."
Conoco Phillips_2305,"Additionally, in 2021 we donated more than $100,000 to  support area Crime Stoppers efforts, local law enforcement  and professional and volunteer fire departments. “Giving to rural first responders is important to us – they  typically don’t receive a lot of funding but they’re responding  to a lot of road accidents, helping people in critical situations. And in those moments, being able to communicate or having  advanced equipment can literally mean the difference  between life and death,” said ConocoPhillips’ Josh Viets, vice  president, Delaware Basin. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Community safety can also be imperiled as a result of citizens  experiencing mental health-related episodes. Since access to  mental health care can be challenging in rural areas, the PSP  recently announced a healthcare initiative aimed at improving  access to resources."
Conoco Phillips_2310,"The over $3 million initiative with West  Texas Counseling & Guidance will expand mental health  services, with a focus on Lea and Eddy counties in southeast  New Mexico and Howard County in Texas. “This partnership is not only expanding access to mental health  care, especially in our rural counties, but it is also building a  pipeline of home-grown providers, who will be more likely  to stay in the Permian Basin and serve our communities,” said  Tracee Bentley, CEO of PSP .In 2021 we donated  more than $100,000  to support area Crime  Stoppers efforts,  local law enforcement  and professional  and volunteer fire  departments. ConocoPhillips Sustainability Report 2021 133 Social SpotlightFostering Inclusion in Australia SPOTLIGHT Creating communities that are fair, inclusive, culturally  sensitive, safe and supportive of all citizens requires  dedication and participation from both residents and  business leaders. For ConocoPhillips Australia, this  includes a commitment to ensuring opportunities are  created for Indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Peoples, businesses and organizations. In 2021,  the team developed and obtained endorsement of  a Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP), a strategic  document that includes a commitment as well as  practical actions that will drive the organization’s  contribution to reconciliation both internally and in  communities."
Conoco Phillips_2315,"The formal, published document is  endorsed by Reconciliation Australia  and is designed to  strengthen relationships between Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Peoples and non-Indigenous Peoples. “As a global energy company, ConocoPhillips has a history  of engagement with First Nations communities, including  those in the United States, Canada and Australia. We strive  to recognize the dignity of all human beings and foster  an environment of inclusion that respects individual  contribution and differences,” said Khoa Dao, President,  ConocoPhillips Australia. The goal of the RAP framework is to guide the company  as we work to positively contribute to race relations  in Australia. ConocoPhillips Australia recognizes the  enduring and unique connection to land and waters that  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have, and  we celebrate their ongoing contributions to Australia’s  political, economic and social landscapes."
Conoco Phillips_2320,"Through the  implementation of the RAP , we are seeking to develop  a deeper understanding of their cultures, histories and  contributions. Additionally, the framework will help  us measure and formalize our commitment and bring  credibility to our intentions and actions to support  diversity and inclusion. We also hope to remove systems  and processes that create participation barriers, promote  engagement and create opportunities. Reconciliation Australia defines the process through five  critical dimensions:   ŰRace relations  ŰEquality and equity  ŰInstitutional integrity  ŰUnity   ŰHistorical acceptance  These form a holistic and comprehensive RAP Framework,  consisting of a governance structure supported by three pillars:  ŰRelationships:  Working to improve and enhance the  relationships between the broader Australia community  and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. For ConocoPhillips, this includes communicating our  commitment to reconciliation and engaging and  educating employees during Reconciliation Week  celebrations."
Conoco Phillips_2325,"ŰRespect:  Increasing the understanding of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander cultures, rights and experiences.

Conoco Phillips_2335,"“We have also  supported community investment initiatives that align with  local community objectives.” Since 201 1, ConocoPhillips Australia has financially supported  a range of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-oriented  community investment initiatives. Program support is  weighted toward education and training programs, many of  which are tailored to specific local area requirements. For the  Indigenous Pathways Traineeship Program, ConocoPhillips  Australia collaborated to create job opportunities in the  natural gas industry for Gladstone locals identifying as  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The program  has run annually since early 2020 and provides two  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander trainees the opportunity  to develop practical skills, through learning hands-on  from experienced LNG professionals and in a classroom  environment. The training counts toward a Certificate II in  Engineering Production upon completion."
Conoco Phillips_2340,"In 2019, ConocoPhillips Australia joined the Yalari scholarship  program, which provides Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander children from rural communities across Australia the  opportunity to receive a full boarding school scholarship  for their entire secondary education. Efforts included a  six-year commitment to support the high school education  of a female Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander student. Through a public/private partnership with the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, ConocoPhillips  Australia is also supporting the Queensland Indigenous  Land and Sea Ranger Program in Central Queensland. Through the program, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Land and Sea Rangers deliver negotiated work plans that  reflect Traditional Owner, local community, and Queensland  Government priorities. Activities include a wide range of  conservation services including cultural burns, feral animal  and pest plant control, soil conservation, cultural heritage  site protection and biodiversity monitoring."

For example, ConocoPhillips is one of many customers of  SolarWinds, a major U.S. information technology firm. As  publicized in December 2020, SolarWinds was subject to a  cyberattack that spread to its clients, including ConocoPhillips. Upon learning of the cyberattack, both from U.S. Cybersecurity  & Infrastructure Security Agency advisories and SolarWinds’  vulnerability notification, ConocoPhillips promptly initiated  actions to investigate and respond to the incident.

Conoco Phillips_2780,"INDICATOR UNITS 2021 5. INDIRECT GHG EMISSIONS FROM CONSUMERS' USE OF PRODUCTS (SCOPE 3) Attention: Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products are released when the hydrocarbons produced and marketed by natural gas and oil companies are combusted  by consumers. GHG emissions from the use of sold products are not within a company’s control, and it should be noted that not 100% of the hydrocarbon products  produced/refined/sold by the company may be combusted at the end of the product life cycle. Scope 3 emissions lead to extensive multiple counting of GHG emissions  across the economy. Therefore, it is inaccurate to add together Scope 3 emissions reported by individual companies in order to ascertain GHG emissions from consumers’  use of oil and natural gas products."
Conoco Phillips_2785,"As noted above, API will not be aggregating Scope 3 emissions data reported by individual companies. For example, an oil and natural  gas company's Scope 3 emissions represent Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions for fuel consumers (e.g., electric utility combusting natural gas, individuals using gasoline,  manufacturers purchasing natural gas to power their operations). Scope 3 emissions on an individual company basis are not an indicator whether global GHG emissions  are being reduced and do not provide context of how GHG emissions fit within the global energy system. Scope 3 emissions are also not indicative of a company’s strategy  to manage potential climate risks and opportunities nor of a company’s commercial strategy or viability. 5.1 Indirect GHG Emissions from Use of Sold Products   (Category 11)(million metric tons CO₂e) 197.6 6."

Conoco Phillips_2815,"Before the data is sent  from the business unit to the corporate level, it undergoes  vetting by technical peers and leaders who challenge any  findings that they find questionable. When the final business  unit data is submitted to the corporate level, it contains an  explanation for all variances greater than 10% from the prior  year. Reasons for significant variances may include startups  or dispositions. At the corporate level, data submitted for  each asset is further reviewed and validated by a team of  subject matter experts.Once all business unit data is compiled at our corporate level,  it undergoes further validation by subject matter experts. During this effort, an intensity analysis is conducted to measure  total volumes and production throughput and year-over-year  data changes to help identify any inconsistencies."
Conoco Phillips_2820,"The data  is also compared to similar operations during this process. The information is then analyzed in aggregate by metric to  understand the significant drivers behind any year-over-year  change in company values. After this process, the data is  presented to company leaders who have an opportunity  to review and challenge the information, possibly spurring  additional verification.

Toyota_20,"As the  issues become increasingly diversi/f_ied and complicated and in view of the ever-changing social trends and external voices, Toyota has identi/f_ied six key issues that it needs to focus particular efforts on as materiality issues, with the aim of both contributing to society and sustainably enhancing its own corporate value. In the process of identifying the six issues, /f_irst we referred to and examined various international norms and guidelines and listed up various issues. Then we gathered external viewpoints, including the opinions of third parties and the priority items of evaluation organizations. We also examined internal viewpoints and organized them from two perspectives to enhance our  corporate value: our “founding spirit,” which represents our principles, strengths and other factors that we have cultivated and that will not change, and factors that we should change or reinforce in the process of our “transformation into a mobility company.” At the same time, we discussed and evaluated the issues to determine whether they are critical issues that will enable Toyota to make further contributions toward building a sustainable society in line with the SDGs.As the automobile industry is entering a once-in-a-century transformational period in which the need to solve social issues is becoming increasingly urgent, companies are required to enhance their commitment to promoting sustainability.

In this spirit, we have tackled various challenges in society. By applying the Toyota Production  System and other technologies we have fostered in our monozukuri (manufacturing), we have  developed the world’s /f_irst commercial hybrid vehicle aimed at resolving environmental issues. We have also contributed to society by making “ever-better cars” that make our customers happy, which has led to the establishment of a stable business base. This virtuous circle has enabled us to achieve sustainable growth for our business activities."
Toyota_40,"Today, propelled by a series of technical innovations called CASE, the automobile industry is  entering a once-in-a-century transformational period. Taking advantage of this opportunity,  Toyota is transforming itself from an automobile manufacturing company into a mobility  company. By making the best of our strengths cultivated through manufacturing while adapting ourselves to technological innovations centered on CASE, we will further expand the potential of automobiles and offer services that make freedom of mobility available to everyone. The development of automated driving and other advanced technologies, for example, is a solution to Toyota’s ultimate challenge: zero deaths and injuries from traf/f_ic accidents. Through these  initiatives, Toyota hopes to provide society with greatly improved value and contribute to the  achievement of SDGs through its businesses."
Toyota_45,"Toyota will also continue to proactively promote social contribution activities with a view to becoming a reliable corporate citizen. Meanwhile, to realize a sustainable society, which the SDGs are aimed at, efforts in tackling  ESG issues, such as human rights and diversity, are necessary. We will enhance our initiatives to address these social issues and promote diversity among our employees, who are our assets, to help them to survive the period of transformation, thereby creating changes in society while leveraging such changes for the further growth of Toyota itself. Toyota believes that it can also contribute to society through promoting motorsports, the purpose of which is to enjoy movement itself, and corporate sport activities, which Toyota has consistently supported since its founding. Seeing those who challenge their limits gives you a heart-pumping feeling excite-ment (waku-doki)."

As climate change progresses, higher temperatures, rising sea levels and severity of natural disasters such as typhoons and flooding are expected. These changes may have various impacts on Toyota’s business fields. These impacts may also pose risks to Toyota’s business, but it is our understanding that if we can respond appropriately, this will lead to enhanced competitiveness and the acquisition of new business opportunities. In accordance with this understanding, we have organized the risks relating to climate change and identified particularly significant risks in line with risk management processes based on the degree of impact and stakeholders' interest."
Toyota_115,"To respond to risks, we are promoting electrification, the introduction of renewable energy in production processes, and adaptation measures for natural disasters.

In case of a society based on the 1.5°C scenario in particular, it is said that the percentage of ZEVs among new vehicle sales will increase greatly and the use of CO 2-free fuels such as biofuels will also expand, mainly for  large cargo and marine/air transport. With regard to effects on production and purchasing, the introduction of carbon taxes and increased tax rates may lead to higher costs, while expanding the use of energy-saving technology, renewable energy and hydrogen will mitigate risks. On the other hand, if adequate climate change measures are not implemented throughout society, production suspensions due to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters such as flooding as well as decreased production and production suspensions due to supply chain disruptions are likely to increase.Consider the Impacts on Toyota Expansion of  carbon taxes  and carbon  pricingPopularization  of renewable  energyIncrease in  physical risks  such as  disastersTightening of ESG  assessment criteria and  calls for disclosureIntroduction of energy-saving technology and expanded use of renewable energy and hydrogenChanges in consumer preferences Advances in battery technologyTightening of policies and vehicle  regulations in various countriesThree Different Images of Society as Toyota’s External EnvironmentResults of the Sixth Toyota Environmental Action Plan (Detail) Strategy and ManagementLife Cycle Zero CO 2 Emissions ChallengeChallenge of Establishing a Future Society in Harmony with NatureNew Vehicle Zero CO 2 Emissions ChallengePlant Zero CO 2 Emissions ChallengeChallenge of Minimizing and Optimizing Water UsageChallenge of Establishing a Recycling-based Society and SystemsEnvironmental DataSociety Promoting Sustainability Environment Governance Overview17 Sustainability Data BookIn April 2021, Toyota proclaimed that it would address global-scale challenges to achieve carbon  neutrality by 2050. It is vital that energy policies (renewable energy, charging infrastructure, etc.)"
Toyota_125,"and industrial policies (purchasing grants, supplier support, battery recycling systems, etc.) are operated in a unified manner to enable the automobile industry to achieve carbon neutrality. Initiatives must be implemented in coordination with various stakeholders such as national governments and industry organizations. When undertaking its business activities globally, Toyota will coordinate with national governments to establish environmental infrastructure for promoting electrification while implementing electrified vehicle strategies that contribute to reducing CO 2 throughout the entire life cycle. Based on this electrified vehicle strategy, Toyota has sold a cumulative total of over 18 million electrified vehicles worldwide."
Toyota_130,"As one of the first companies to respond to climate change risks, it has achieved a CO 2 reduction of over 140 million tons. Going forward, with regards to battery electric  vehicles (BEVs), we will successively introduce models with dedicated platforms starting in 2022 and seek to achieve practical vehicle supply through battery development and production strategies. In addition to BEVs, we are promoting electrification from all directions including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). We will respond flexibly and strategically to each demand for varying powertrains depending on the scenario. Sales of electrified vehicles will be optimized for each region by introducing BEVs in regions where the emission factors from electricity are low and promoting emissions reductions through HEVs in regions where the emission factors are high.In December 2021, we announced our aim of developing 30 types of BEVs and achieving a full lineup in the passenger and commercial segments globally by 2030 to reach 3.5 million annual global vehicle sales by 2030."
Toyota_135,"In light of changes in the market, we will continue to flexibly increase total vehicle sales while leveraging the strengths that we have gained through our experience so far to increase the number of options for electrified vehicles. This will encourage customers in each region to choose us and accelerate the increased use of electrified vehicles. Even if battery demand increases in accordance with altered customer needs under the below 2°C scenario and 1.5°C scenario, we will work toward achieving carbon neutrality through flexible response such as enhancing collaboration with partners, considering a collaboration structure with new partners, and swiftly establishing production structures at suppliers that have capital ties with Toyota. In addition to increasing the number of electrified vehicles, it is important to expand technology options to reduce CO 2 emissions of vehicles currently in use as well. This may include the adoption of  CO 2-reducing off-cycle technology* (although not reflected in mode fuel efficiency) and the  development of engines that can use CO 2-free fuel such as hydrogen engine vehicle."
Toyota_140,"In order to  achieve carbon neutrality, we will work together not only with the automobile industry, but with all industries while continuing to engage in challenges to respond to a society based on the 1.5°C scenario through initiatives that are practical as well as sustainable.In the production field, we announced that we aim to achieve carbon neutrality at global plants by 2035. We are promoting the reduction of CO 2 emissions through comprehensive energy-saving  technology and the introduction of renewable energy and hydrogen at plants, and have already achieved 100 percent renewable electricity introduction rate at all plants in Europe and South America. Furthermore, we will prepare to face risks such as carbon taxes through initiatives such as these. In addition, we will prepare adaptation measures to respond to natural disasters such as formulating a business continuity plan (BCP), strengthening the supply chain by enhancing information gathering and improving communication.To confirm the suitability and progress of Toyota’s strategies, we will conduct appropriate information disclosures regarding various ESG assessment indicators and enhance dialogue with stakeholders including institutional investors.

Toyota_220,"Green Purchasing Guidelines3 3 Green Purchasing Guidelines: Guidelines that Toyota requires all of its tier 1 suppliers to follow to promote environmental management  in the supply chain Supplying Vehicles According to Energy Situation In order to reduce CO 2 emissions from vehicles during driving, it is important to select optimal vehicles  according to local energy situations and the status of infrastructure development. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) do not emit CO 2 during driving (TtW), but CO 2  emissions during the production stage of electricity used for charging and hydrogen used as fuel, varies depending on the production methods. The potential for reducing CO 2 emissions can be expanded  even for vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines by developing clean fuels, such as biofuel and e-fuel, and hydrogen engines that generates power through the combustion of hydrogen.Toyota will supply vehicles that customers need by expanding and enhancing low-CO 2 technologies  and establishing a full lineup of electrified vehicles.Promoting Environmental Management in the Vehicle Life Cycle Toyota has been working to reduce CO 2 emissions throughout the vehicle life cycle with the aim of a  totally clean car manufacturing that adopts LCA1 methods. One such effort is the Eco Vehicle  Assessment System (Eco-VAS), which was introduced in 2005. Eco-VAS is a management system that sets environmental targets during the vehicle development stage under the guidance of the chief engineer and takes steady measures to achieve those targets in order to reduce environmental impact through the life span of a vehicle."

Toyota is leading the Hydrogen Utilization Study Group in the Chubu to create mechanisms for the use of hydrogen energy throughout society in collaboration with companies in other industries, contributing to the realization of a decarbonized society. With respect to the utilization of hydrogen at plants, we are developing hydrogen burners that can decarbonize the combustion process, expanding the use of fuel cell (FC) forklifts and promoting production and use of renewable energy-derived hydrogen at plants by introducing water electrolysis-based machine for hydrogen generation and filling (Motomachi Plant). Furthermore, we are installing hydrogen-fueled power generators and conducting verification testing. (Below: Shimoyama Plant; Right: Honsha Plant)."
Toyota_285,"Going forward, we will develop technologies for carbon capture and reuse and other technologies with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality at all global plants by 2035.Operation of Hydrogen Power Generation Facility Starts at Honsha Plant to Expand Hydrogen Utilization With the aim of achieving zero CO 2 emissions from in-house power  generation facilities at our plants, we introduced three different types of power generating facilities at the Honsha Plant: a stationary FC generator diverting the Mirai’s on-board FC, a pure hydrogen FC generator with high power generating efficiency that enables the use of waste heat, and a co-firing gas engine generator of natural gas and hydrogen. The combined generating capacity is 600 kW, and a portion of the hydrogen fuel used is recovered hydrogen that in the past was released. Verification tests are underway to achieve highly efficient power generation systems. The technologies gained from this hydrogen power generation facility will be rolled out to other plants with the aim for an early achievement of plant zero CO 2 emissions. We also created a structure to use the hydrogen stored for power generation and automobile FCs for supply to the adjacent hydrogen station in the event of a disaster."

Toyota_475,"2 To help remedy this situation,  Toyota has installed Intelligent Clearance Sonars (ICS) since 2012. For vehicles that are already owned by customers, Toyota introduced a pedal misapplication acceleration control system that can be retro/f_itted in 2018.These systems activate when the sensor detects an obstacle, such as a car or a wall. However, some of the accidents caused by pedal misapplication occurred when there were no obstacles on the road. To reduce such accidents, Toyota developed the sudden acceleration suppression  function to help prevent accidents caused by sudden acceleration in a road condition with no  obstacles, and began installing it from the Prius and the Prius PHV launched in July 2020.This function has also been incorporated in the retro/f_it Pedal Misapplication Acceleration Control System II. As of July 2021, the Pedal Misapplication Acceleration Control System and the Pedal Misapplication Acceleration Control System II are available for 12 and 15 models, respectively (Japan).Based on the principle that safety lies in the domain of cooperation, Toyota has disclosed the concept of the sudden acceleration suppression function and its speci/f_ic operating conditions to other car manufacturers from the development stage, thereby promoting industry-wide efforts to reduce accidents caused by pedal misapplication.Toyota Safety Sense (Active Safety Package)The Toyota Safety Sense system incorporates three major functions considered effective in reducing serious traf/f_ic accidents causing death or injury."
Toyota_480,"It packages multiple active safety  functions based around Pre-Collision Safety (PCS), which works to either help avoid collisions with  cars ahead or pedestrians, Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane, and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front at night. In 2018, we enhanced functions to support driving, such as detecting nighttime pedestrians and daytime crossing cyclists, and Lane Tracing Assist (LTA).The third generation of the Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) package launched in autumn 2021 has extended the range of detection by using newly-developed millimeter-wave radar and a monocular camera. In addition to vehicle, pedestrian and cyclist detection, it has become possible to detect motorcycles. Moreover, the TSS package incorporates PCS, which supports to prevent intersection collisions, and Proactive Driving Assist (PDA), which assists steering and deceleration by using AI to help avoid collisions with pedestrians and driving/parked vehicles. By anticipating risks according to driving situations on ordinary roads, PDA supports the driver in avoiding getting  too close to danger, leading to peace of mind for the driver."
Toyota_485,"Since its market launch in 2015, Toyota Safety Sense has been installed in more than 27 million vehicles globally (as of October 2021). Toyota Safety Sense is now available on nearly all passenger car models (as standard or option) in the Japanese, United States and European markets. It has also been introduced in a total of 120 countries and regions, including China, other select Asian countries, the Middle East and Australia.

In 1995, Toyota set up unique, stringent internal targets related to passive safety performance called “Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA)” in the pursuit of world-leading safety levels and decided to develop a collision-safety body and passenger protection devices."
Toyota_490,"Since then, to maintain leader-ship in this /f_ield, Toyota has continued to advance GOA, continuously pursuing the real safety performance of its vehicles in a wide variety of accidents.To analyze human body injuries in traf/f_ic accidents, Toyota developed its Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS), a virtual body model, jointly with Toyota Central R&D Labs., Inc. THUMS is being utilized effectively in research and development of various safety technologies, including safety equipment such as seat belts and airbags and vehicle structures that mitigate injuries in accidents involving pedestrians. Toyota has made THUMS software freely available on its website since January 2021, in the hope of having THUMS utilized broadly by more users.THUMS, a Virtual Body ModelTHUMS has been used by over 100 car manufacturers and parts manufacturers, universities and research institutions both inside and outside Japan mainly for studies on vehicle safety. Models of a variety of bodies in terms of gender, age and size are available. The use of these models enables  comparison of injuries to various types of occupants and pedestrians, allowing researchers to  conduct safety research on themes focusing on diversity. Furthermore, the latest Version 6 can simulate a variety of pre-collision conditions of occupant muscles in, for example, braced and relaxed postures."
Toyota_495,"THUMS Version 6 also enables studies of the in/f_luence exerted by changes in occupant posture at the time of hard braking.Meanwhile, Toyota promotes its Integrated Safety Management Concept. We are working on  technology development for preventive link functions that operate protective devices in a collision  by linking with the Pre-collision Safety (PCS) system. We have developed functions that prepare  to deploy the seatbelt system or SRS* side & curtain shield airbags to help protect the occupants when the PCS determines that a collision with another vehicle is likely, or prepare to deploy the pop-up hood to help protect the pedestrian or cyclist when the PCS determines that a collision with a pedestrian or cyclist is likely. * SRS (Supplemental Restraint System): A system of supplementary restraints to protect occupants Occupant models of THUMS Version 4 Occupant model of THUMS Version 6 3YO (3 years old)6YO (6 years old)10YO (10 years old)AF05 (small woman)AM95 (large man)AM50 (medium-sized man) THUMS Muscle (Example of braced posture when the driver applies the brake)Muscle (Example of braced posture when the driver applies the brake)Effects of Toyota Safety Sense P and ICS on Accident Reduction * Based on an analysis of accidents occurring in parking lots  involving the Alphard, Vell/f_ire, and Prius Based on a survey of data concerning approximately 2,500  accidents from insurance companies that cover the policies for  about 60,000 of the above-mentioned vehicle models  Subject vehicle series: Alphard, Vell/f_ire, Prius Survey period: January 2015–June 2016 Survey subjects: Approximately 63,000 vehicles, of which  26,000 were equipped with ICS (42%) * Pedal misapplication was identi/f_ied as the accident cause  based on customer reports* Based on an analysis of ITARDA data The accident incidence rate is calculated by dividing the number of accidents by the number of vehicles in operation  (converted from the number of vehicles sold based on the  timing of sale)  Subject vehicle series: Prius Survey period: December 2015–December 2016 Survey subjects: Approximately 247,000 vehicles, of which  approximately 84,000 were equipped with Toyota Safety Sense P , and approximately 121,000 were equipped with Toyota Safety Sense P and ICSAccident Reduction Effects In real traf/f_ic environments, installation of the ICS in cars has reduced the number of accidents caused by pedal misapplication by about 70 percent.

The /f_irst-phase project was completed at the CSRC in March 2017. Over a /f_ive-year period, the CSRC started and completed 44 research projects jointly with 23 universities and research organizations, publishing more than 200 technical papers.The CSRC has been making its research results public through presentations at various vehicle safety-related conferences so that these results can be utilized by people engaged in the development of vehicle and traf/f_ic safety technologies.In 2017, Toyota started a new second-phase project called “CSRC Next.” This re/f_lects Toyota’s position that it is important to understand how humans will cope with advancing vehicle technologies."
Toyota_515,"Toyota will invest 35 million dollars over /f_ive years in research focusing on issues related to and the possibilities of autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies, and publish the research results publicly, thereby contributing to safer vehicles industry-wide.To help achieve zero casualties from traf/f_ic accidents, Toyota has been conducting research and  development on automated driving technologies since the 1990s. Toyota’s unique approach to automated driving, called the “Mobility Teammate Concept,” seeks out a relationship between people and vehicles so that they can communicate and mutually improve one another as companions would. Based on this philosophy, Toyota is aiming to help build a world in which  every person, including the elderly and the physically challenged, can enjoy mobility safely, easily  and freely.The Lexus Teammate and Toyota Teammate are advanced drive support technologies developed based on the Mobility Teammate Concept. With the functions of Advanced Drive for driving support on highways and Advanced Park for parking support in parking lots, these technologies enable the driver and the car to collaborate in ensuring high levels of safety and drive with the sense of a high level of security while providing tireless, comfortable travel to the destination.In April 2021, Toyota launched Lexus LS and MIRAI equipped with Advanced Drive in Japan. AI technology centered on deep learning is incorporated to forecast various situations that may be encountered while driving and provide assistance for driver responses."
Toyota_520,"In addition, Advanced Drive uses software updates so that functions can be added and updated after the vehicle is delivered to the customer, enhancing convenience and providing the latest safety technologies. To grasp vehicle behavior under constantly changing conditions, collected exterior image data  and other driving data are transmitted to Toyota’s data server. * These data are utilized as reference for future research and development of automated driving, advanced safety and mapping technologies. Automated Driving * The privacy and security of the drivers and individuals captured on camera are taken into consideration when this data is collected and  processed.Believing that educating people is also important in preventing traf/f_ic accidents, Toyota has been  carrying out various activities.To keep children safe on roads, in collaboration with Toyota dealers nationwide, Toyota has been donating traf/f_ic safety teaching materials for small children to kindergarten and nursery school  children all over Japan since 1969. In 2020, we renewed our traf/f_ic safety education website for  children and their guardians."
Toyota_525,"Using our website and SNS, we are raising awareness of traf/f_ic safety in various situations, including while walking and riding a bicycle on the road.For drivers, Toyota holds Toyota Driver Communication, a safe driving technique seminar, on a regular basis at the Toyota Safety Education Center Mobilitas at the Fuji Speedway.Additionally, with the spread of the Safety Support Car (Sapo Car) program recommended by the  government, we are working with Toyota dealers to continue to spread our safety technologies  further and keep our customers informed.

Since its foundation, Toyota has established a corporate culture that focuses particular attention on quality that will produce customer smiles and on kaizen (continuous improvement) achieved through genchi genbutsu (onsite hands-on experience). Each employee in every area maintains a constant  and strong awareness of issues and a sense of ownership and makes ongoing efforts to implement kaizen and to collaborate  closely with personnel in other /f_ields to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, and satisfaction. Toyota’s Concept of Quality Quality Assurance CycleQuality and Customer Organizational Structure Quality Toyota sees quality as a combination of product quality, sales and service quality, and the quality of work performed by each employee that serves, as the foundation supporting the other aspects of quality.We believe that products and services that gain the con/f_idence of customers can be only created when all employees who engage in every process, from development, purchasing, production, and sales to after-sales service activities, build quality into their work  and implement the quality assurance cycle by linking the various processes.The fundamentals of the initiatives are function management and  policy management."
Toyota_530,"Function management refers to setting  company-wide policies based on functional parameters such as quality and safety, with each group and company taking action in collaboration with other divisions.Policy management refers to the formulation and implementation of plans for achieving targets in each group and company, based on the company-wide policy.In terms of policy management for quality functions, policies and important issues related to quality are discussed and decided at meetings of the Quality Function Board, the highest-order confer-ences of Toyota related to quality, attended by presidents of companies and of/f_icers of relevant groups, thereby promoting  company-wide quality improvement. Each year, Toyota formulates a plan for addressing company-wide quality issues and ensuring quality corresponding to new businesses and technologies, and deploys it as our quality function policy throughout the company. In order to strengthen regionally led quality improvement activities capable of making decisions and taking actions as close as possible to local customers, Toyota has appointed a Global Chief Quality Of/f_icer (Global CQO) in Japan as the person responsible for global quality assurance, and Chief Quality Of/f_icers (CQOs) in other regions around the world. For the meeting of the Quality Function Board held in January, the CQOs are gathered from all  regions to evaluate the achievement of the targets stipulated in  quality function policies. Based on the evaluation, the CQOs also discuss and decide new policies and targets.Additionally, each region has organized a variety of quality-related conferences."
Toyota_535,"For the highest-order conference chaired by the regional CQO, Toyota Motor Corporation sends our Global CQO or a secretariat member in order to facilitate and support better communication and collaboration. Toyota also shares our quality function policy with our af/f_iliated group companies and suppliers, promoting collaborative actions for ensuring quality. Moreover, initiatives implemented under the quality function policy are reported to the management, including directors, each month, and are properly addressed.GRI416-1, 417-1 Updated in October 2021 Fundamental ApproachSociety Promoting Sustainability Environment Governance Overview Social Data SafetyQuality and Customer FirstDiversity and Inclusion Human Rights Business Partners Health and Safety Human Resources Intellectual PropertyInformation Security and PrivacySocial Contribution59 Sustainability Data BookChief: G-CQO Chief: CQO Collaboration (coordination of action items) Collaboration (reciprocal participation, sharing progress information)Global Policy ManagementPolicy Quality ConferencePolicy ManagementRegion Quality Function BoardQuality Function Policy Responses to global issues Regional Quality Function BoardRegional Quality Function Policies Responses to regional issues Chairperson: Customer First  Promotion Group Chief Of/f_icer Participants: Chief of/f_icers and company presidentsChairperson: Regional CQO Participants: Representatives of  individual af/f_iliates and functionsEstablishing Quality Assurance Structure toward Transformation into a “Mobility” Company As the automotive industry faces an era of profound transformation, the likes of which come only  once every 100 years, Toyota is taking many steps to transform itself into a “mobility” company. In the mobility society that will arrive in the future, in addition to automobiles’ basic safety and comfort (quality of things), in such areas as running, turning, and stopping, it is necessary to ensure the  quality and security of the communication automobiles use to connect to people, things, and cities. The quality of the telecommunication platform and servers, which control the operations of services, must also be ensured in order to guarantee the quality of customers’ experiences (quality of experi-ences) obtained through mobility services."
Toyota_540,"With this in mind, Toyota is also making company-wide efforts to strengthen the quality assurance process, including in its services, in order to provide high-quality products and services that bring a smile to customers’ faces in its mobility businesses. Fostering Quality-oriented Awareness and Culture “Customer First,” “Quality First,” and “Build in Quality in Processes.” Based on these principles we have maintained since our foundation, to foster a corporate culture in which each member is committed to building high quality, Toyota has been working toward developing human resources and improving work quality by holding quality promotion events for all employees (including Customer’s Month, Quality  Month, and All-Toyota TQM Convention) every year and also by providing rank-speci/f_ic education in  quality assurance. Meanwhile, February 24, the day that President Akio Toyoda attended U.S. Congressional hearings, held to investigate the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010, was designated “Toyota Restart Day.” We are creating mechanisms and taking measures to raise awareness in order to maintain focus on the lessons learned from the experiences Toyota underwent at that time.In 2014, Toyota established its Customer Quality Learning Center as a crucial education facility for conveying the experiences and lessons Toyota learned from the series of recall issues to future genera-tions of employees. Using exhibits that appeal to the /f_ive senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts and vehicle simulators, the Center acts as an important education facility for conveying the situation back then to current Toyota employees.In addition to posting the status of the series of recall issues, current quality issues are added to update the program every year. In this way, we are making efforts to create key education facilities for maintaining focus on all that Toyota learned."
Toyota_545,"We have also set up customer quality learning centers unique to individual plants and overseas sites, and are working to ensure employees in each region and each plant thoroughly understand the importance of quality. Additionally, employees who experienced the series of recall issues take on the role of storyteller to convey the experiences and lessons learned within their own work sites.

A Customer Feedback Board summarizing customer feedback has been added to the company intranet, drawing employee attention to issues of concern to customers.Additionally, we are actively encouraging some of our employees to obtain the Consumer Affairs Advisor quali/f_ication, which is certi/f_ied by Japan’s Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. Facility and vehicle evaluations from the customer’s viewpoint are also held by a group of experts in the Toyota Consumer Affairs Advisor Group.Education To bring smiles to the faces of as many customers as possible, it is essential to simultaneously achieve both better cars and better after-sales service. Customer’s cars require regular check-ups, legally mandated inspections and repairs following breakdowns or accidents. After-sales service provides safety, peace of mind and comfort to customers at these times and provides continuous support for the Toyota and Lexus brands.In recent years, the average length of time for which a car is used is increasing."
Toyota_585,"As a result, the role of after-sales service is becoming increasingly important. Toyota is taking measures to provide ever-better services in accordance with the concept of  the 3S Spirit (Seikaku  + Shinsetsu  = Shinrai: Accuracy +  Caring = Trust) so that we can achieve high levels of  satisfaction for our customers in using their Toyota vehicles.Better service means the ability to accurately, promptly and inexpensively perform maintenance and repairs in cases of breakdown. To do this, we are making efforts in terms of the  factors shown in the /f_igure below. Based on the idea that after-sales service begins at the stage  of vehicle development, we believe that service is also one aspect of a car’s performance, and we incorporate improvement policies based on market feedback and repair records into our vehicle development so that customers can safely use their vehicles for a long time. Toyota has also established a system to deliver parts exactly when they are needed to countries around the world so that repairs and  other services can be completed speedily."
Toyota_590,"Parts inventories  and inspection work are being made more ef/f_icient by applying Toyota Production System concepts at dealer worksites. Furthermore, Toyota has been using rebuilt products to lessen customers’ burden of repair and alleviate environmental burdens by reusing products.To promptly support repair work, the number of diagnostic codes for identifying failure causes has been signi/f_icantly increased. A diagnostic code can identify a particular failed  After-sales Servicepart by detecting a fault through the self-diagnosis of the on-board computer, helping speed up repair work. We are also taking innovative steps to improve service operation ef/f_iciency by reducing the number of frequently performed  operations or automating them. Service, technology, sales and other divisions are collaborating on repair techniques to deploy easy-to-repair car manufacturing."
Toyota_595,"They also provide necessary information to make repair work speedy and easy.There are currently approximately 180,000 Toyota personnel  involved in after-sales service globally, and educational  systems and facilities are being established in each region. The Tajimi Service Center in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, plays a central role in enhancing the knowledge and technical skills of service staff worldwide. Helping Customers Use Their Vehicles Safely User manuals and information on the latest models are  available on the Toyota website to help customers enjoy driving their vehicles safely and comfortably.We are also utilizing the product information provision tools for distributors and dealers as well as the company website to accurately communicate the risks resulting from operational errors. Initiative with Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory  CouncilSince dealers offer services to customers directly, Toyota is working with dealers to provide ever-better cars and ever-better services.In Japan, the sectional meetings between the Toyota National Dealers’ Advisory Council and Toyota are discussing after-sales service. Technical Sectional Meetings, which have been held regularly since 1977, investigate quality issues and serviceability from the customer’s perspective."

Toyota engages directly with group companies and Tier-1 suppliers, whereas with regards to Tier-2 and other suppliers that are found deeper within the supply chain, the effectiveness of collaboration with other stakeholders has been proven."
Toyota_710,"Our aim is to also partner with external stakeholders to fully understand and align with societal expectations, while also maintaining legal compliance in all of our operations and within our supply chain.To meet the expectations of our stakeholders, we tackle issues relating to human rights in reference to international norms such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At Toyota, the Human Resources Division promotes the above activity by thoroughly communicating with both the Purchasing Group and the Sustainability Management Department. Human Rights Approach The strategy and policy for the human rights approach are discussed and agreed upon within the framework of the organization for sustainability management, and then reported to the Board of Directors Meeting. Risk information is reported monthly to management in relevant divisions and quarterly to relevant executives. In the course of these reports, potential risks to stakeholders, including those within our own business operations as well as those of our supply chain, are  assessed and measures to be taken are prioritized."
Toyota_715,"Decisions made by the organization for  sustainability management are then communicated to our stakeholders, including labor unions, global  af/f_iliates, group companies and suppliers, on a monthly basis. Material Risk Identi/f_ication In the process of identifying key human rights risks, Toyota refers to various international norms and standards to guide its methodology, processes and actions. Broad risk assessments are made at the Sustainability Meeting in terms of ESG criteria. With regards to human rights issues related to the automobile industry and other emerging risks, Toyota consults human rights experts and other relevant stakeholders to classify and analyze the risks from two viewpoints, namely, the public interest and the impact on our business. Typically, risks that are identi/f_ied as high risk from both these viewpoints are considered material."
Toyota_720,"Human Rights Methodology While working on initiatives related to human rights, Toyota speci/f_ically created a human rights process for its operations in 2019. As part of this activity, Toyota published the “Toyota’s action taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers (Statement on the Modern Slavery Acts)” covering migrant labor issues in March 2021 (updated in September). Toyota continues to develop and enhance this process. The following sections aim to describe some of the key human rights-related activities that have been introduced into our business operations. Monitoring of Human Rights Issues The daily operations relating to human rights for both internal and supplier operations are admin-istered by the relevant functions under the leadership of the Sustainability Management Department."
Toyota_725,"The activities include a regular monitoring process to grasp human rights-related concerns within Toyota’s operations and also those of the supply chain. After the assessment of risk areas, Toyota’s position relating to the risks is determined and then necessary due diligence  is conducted. The monitoring channels used consists of grievance mechanisms, media sources,  business networks, union communications and investor engagement. Countermeasure Activities For each of the prioritized risks, Toyota develops a risk mitigation plan through an agreement with the affected stakeholders and suppliers while also being guided by specialist external bodies. These plans are tracked on a monthly basis and reviewed annually by the human rights-related functions to evaluate both the progress and effectiveness of the activity."

Due to the nature of Toyota’s business, we also recognize the possible risks of forced labor within our business and supply chain involving migrant workers.As part of our due diligence activities, we have been working with non-governmental organizations to ensure fair working  conditions for migrant workers within our af/f_iliates and suppli- ers both inside and outside Japan. This has included the development of guidelines to help eliminate possible exploita-tion by unscrupulous employment agencies charging high recruitment fees, as well as ensuring freedom of movement, fair treatment, and proper employment contracts for migrant workers. (Please refer to the link “Toyota’s action taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers (Statement on the Modern Slavery Acts)”We have also partnered on the development of the “ASSC Tokyo Declaration 2020.” This is a set of 13 declarations created to enhance and respect the rights of migrant workers from the moment of recruitment, during overseas employ-ment, and until their safe return to their home countries."

Migrant WorkersAssessing Migrant Labor-related Risks in Toyota’s Direct Global OperationsToyota assesses migrant labor-related risks based on an understanding of the latest trends related to migrant labor and the expectations of stakeholders. We have created a task force to develop comprehensive surveys to grasp the current situation at Toyota subsidiaries both in Japan and  overseas, speci/f_ically, to determine the number of migrant  workers*, the countries the workers migrated from, the percentage of indirect recruitment, and whether there were any possible issues in the recruitment and/or repatriation process (e.g., charging of recruitment fees, withholding of passports or identi/f_ication documents, prohibition of return to the home country, etc.). Based on the data gathered, we have determined that no infringements are being placed upon migrant workers at our subsidiaries. Due to the signi/f_icant increase in the number of migrant  workers being employed in Japan as a whole and within our domestic operations, we decided to investigate the situation of our Group companies and their major Tier-1 suppliers and our own major Tier-1 suppliers (the top 276 suppliers accounting for 90% of the total procurement value) by focusing our attention on foreign technical internship  trainees*, who are at high risk of debt bonded labor."
Toyota_740,"Through our dialogue with our external stakeholders, we  recognized that there is risk in hiring migrant workers from  employment agencies in their sending countries and supervis-ing organizations in Japan, since it may result in forced labor due to the migrant workers being charged exorbitant fees, ensnaring them in serious debt.Through the surveys, we have been able to ascertain that, among Toyota’s Tier-1 suppliers, 22 companies employ foreign technical internship trainees from af/f_iliated companies, and 102 companies employ trainees via employment agencies in the sending country and supervising organizations in Japan. Upon further investigation, we found that the countries dispatching technical internship trainees were  mainly comprised of China and various South East Asian  countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. In order to mitigate any possible human rights infringements associated with the migration of technical internship trainees, we plan to: Promote corrective actions for zero tolerance of unreason- able fees borne by migrant workers that induce the possibil-ity of forced labor  Work closely with suppliers to share best practices to avoid  human rights infringements of migrant workers  Support supplier due diligence for agencies acquiring  migrant workers in coordination with NGOsToyota's action taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers  (Statement on the Modern Slavery Acts) ASSC Tokyo Declaration 2020 Migrant Workers at Toyota Subsidiaries by RegionForeign Technical Internship Trainees Utilization (Japan) Region No. of Migrant Workers Japan Asia-Paci/f_ic Europe North America Southern Africa Latin America Oceania China600 460420 57 5000No. of Companies SurveyedNo."

As of March 2020, the supply chain related to batteries, a major component using cobalt, has largely been clari/f_ied, with several smelters identi/f_ied.Toyota will continue to conduct background investigation of smelters, thereby identifying and assessing human rights risks including child labor. If any risk is identi/f_ied as a result of the survey, we will develop appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.Responsible Sourcing of Cobalt Toyota has conducted a reasonable country-of-origin inquiry with due diligence throughout its global supply chain since 2013. In 2020, Toyota again conducted a survey of its automotive and marine businesses in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Con/f_lict-affected and High-risk Areas.Before conducting the survey, Toyota formulated a manual detailing how to /f_ill in the survey sheet and developed a tool, both of which were to be used by suppliers to compile the survey results."

Organization for Sustainability Management p. 5Corporate Governance Business Execution and SupervisionFundamental Approach Contributing to society through monozukuri (manufacturing) is the basis of  Toyota’s corporate value. To enhance its corporate value in the medium- to  long-term, it is appropriate for Toyota to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, where internal executives who have been long engaged in and have deep knowledge of manufacturing, and outside executives who are capable of providing advice for the creation of new value from a broad perspective, can participate in well-balanced decision making at the Board of Directors’ meetings.With respect to its framework for executing its operations, Toyota, has been continuing its efforts to respond swiftly to the external environment, which is changing faster than ever."
Toyota_1130,"Following the introduction of “region-based management” in 2011, the “business unit system” in 2013, and the “in-house company system” in 2016, in 2017, Toyota further clari/f_ied that Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for decision-making and management oversight and that operating of/f_icers are responsible for operational execution for purposes of further accelerating decision-making and operational execution.Furthermore, in 2018, Toyota brought forward the timing of executive changes from April, when it used to take place, to January, in order to further accelerate management oversight that is fully coordinated with the workplace. In addition, Toyota transformed the company structure into one that enables decision-making that is both close to the needs of customers and close to where the action takes place, by taking measures such as reviewing the corporate strategy function and restructuring the Japan Sales Business Group into a group based by regions rather than sales channels.In 2019, to further advance its “acceleration of management” and the development of a diverse and talented workforce, Toyota made executive and organizational changes as follows: Executives are composed of only senior managing of/f_icers and people of higher rank. A new classi/f_ication called “senior professional/senior management” (kanbushoku in Japanese) grouped and replaced the following titles or ranks; managing of/f_icers, executive general managers, (sub-executive managerial level) senior grade 1 and senior grade 2 managers, and grand masters. From the perspective of appointing the right people to the right positions, senior professionals/senior management are positioned in a wide range of posts, from those of chief of/f_icer, deputy chief of/f_icer, plant general manager, senior general manager to group manager, regardless of age or length of employment, to deal with management issues as they arise and to strengthen their development as part of a diverse and talented workforce through genchi genbutsu (on-site learning and problem-solving).

Toyota believes that it is critical to appoint individuals who contribute to decision-making aimed at sustainable growth into the future according to the concept of the “Toyoda Precepts,” which set forth our founding philosophy. Moreover, these individuals should be able to play a signi/f_icant role in transforming Toyota into a “mobility company” through responding to social transformation by using CASE* and building external partnerships, while working in further- ance of the SDGs and towards solutions for other social challenges. The Board of Directors should  consist of members who have the abundant knowledge, deep insight and the highly professional expertise needed by Toyota and members are appointed with consideration for diversity. For each Director candidate, members of the Executive Appointment Meeting, of which the majority are Outside Directors, make recommendations to the Board of Directors.Furthermore, three Outside Members of the Board of Directors have been appointed in order to adequately re/f_lect the opinions of those from outside the company in management’s decision-making process, and all of them are registered as independent of/f_icers with the relevant /f_inancial instruments exchanges.Toyota considers the appointment of Outside Members of the Board of Directors as independent of/f_icers in accordance with the requirements for Outside Members of the Board of Directors set out in the Companies Act and independence standards established by the relevant /f_inancial instruments  exchanges."
Toyota_1145,"Outside Members of the Board of Directors provide advice in Toyota’s management decision-making process based on their broad experience and insight, independently from the management structure.To allow the insight of Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board to be fully made use of, Toyota has launched the following measures: (1) Review the criteria for submission of proposals to the Board of Directors as needed to reduce the  number of proposals submitted, so that suf/f_icient time can be secured to discuss each proposal. (2) Provide an explanation of all proposals in advance to help understand the background of the  proposals. (3) Remove the time limit for discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings to ensure suf/f_icient  discussion can be held. (4) Besides the Board of Directors meetings, set periodic opportunities for two-way communication  between Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board and the  operational execution side on important management issues and medium-to long-term issues.

Samsung_10,"Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2021 1CEO’s Message Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.  Vice Chairman and CEO Kim, Kinam Dear shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees of Samsung Electronics, we thank you for your continuous support and interest in our company. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shook the world, fueling an unprec - edented public health crisis and prompting an economic slowdown  as nations closed borders and implemented new safety measures to protect their populations. At the same time, the damaging effects of racial discrimination and a prevalent digital divide have become strikingly clear, while the importance of tackling climate change continues to grow. Against the backdrop of these unprecedented times, it is no surprise  that consumer behavior has changed, with priorities shifting to focus on areas such as health, safety, and sustainability. Expectations also continue to grow on corporations for sustainable business practices and operations."
Samsung_15,"As a `sustainable, centennial company', we need to grow together  with society to ensure we create a lasting legacy for future genera-tions to come. We have worked hard at every level to help our various stakeholders, supporting local communities and employees overcome challenges and adapt to the new environment as we return to our daily lives in a post-pandemic world. We provided financial support to suppliers struggling from the  COVID-19 situation to help them stabilize their operations. We pro-vided medical staff and those particularly vulnerable to the crisis with medical and relief supplies as well as financial support. We con-tributed to accelerating COVID-19 testing and vaccine roll-outs by sharing our expertise and knowledge with small and medium-sized enterprises producing test kits and low dead space (LDS) syringes."
Samsung_20,"In addition, under the CSR vision of ""Together for Tomorrow! Enabling People"", we donated tools and equipment, such as tablet PCs, to support young students with their studies online, aiming to lessen the digital divide among students around the globe.The pandemic has also served to remind us of the severe environ - mental issues we face. Notably, as the new climate regime has been implemented since 2021 in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the international community is now at a watershed moment in the fight against climate change. As a responsible global company, we are engaged in numerous ini- tiatives to minimize our environmental footprint, from product development to production and, finally, disposal. As part of our efforts to tackle climate change, we are proud to  report that from 2020, all of our worksites in the United States, Europe, and China were 100% powered by renewable energy sources."
Samsung_25,"We plan to build on this success by expanding our renewable energy use in other regions. Meanwhile, we continue to drive a circular economy through techno - logical innovations and the development of high-efficiency products  with greater durability. Our new programs, such as Galaxy Upcycling and Eco-Package, encourage consumers to participate in efforts to build a sustainable future in their day to day lives. We are deeply aware of the fact that compliance and integrity man- agement are at the foundation of sustainability management. We have updated our Global Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy  to cultivate a deeply rooted compliance culture, and work with the  external Samsung Compliance Committee to strictly monitor and manage any compliance risks, throughout the company."
Samsung_30,"The unprecedented crisis has brought about rapid changes in the  way people live their daily lives. Guided by our management philos-ophy which states, “we will devote our human resources and tech - nology to create superior products and services, thereby contribut - ing to a better global society,” and capitalizing on our technological advances and knowledge gained through many years of experience, we will continue to work with our stakeholders and society as a whole to allow a smooth and successful return to normalcy. Thank you. 2 Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2021Company Overview Our goal is to devote our human resources and technology to create superior products and services and contribute to a better global  society. To this end, we have used the five Samsung business principles to create detailed action plans, establishing the Samsung Electronics Global Code of Conduct to guide our employees."

The Board of Directors assists management in deci- sion making by reviewing and resolving matters stipulated by law or the Articles of Incorporation, matters delegated by a gen - eral meeting of shareholders, and important matters related to our fundamental business policies and operations as a part of  its supervision of management's actions."
Samsung_50,"The composition and  operation of the Board of Directors are determined by our Articles of Incorporation and the Regulations of the Board of Directors, which are stricter than the standards stipulated by the Commer - cial Act of South Korea. This enables us to enhance the inde-pendence, transparency, expertise, and diversity of the Board. Board Composition The Board of Directors can be composed of three to fourteen members  in accordance with Article 24 of the Articles of Incorporation. Although Article 383 of the Commercial Act stipulates that the Board only needs three or more members, we allow up to fourteen members consider - ing the scale of our business, and the need to increase the efficiency of operations and decision making. As of March 31, 2021, our Board of Directors consists of eleven members, six of whom are Independent Directors, in accordance with Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act, which requires a company to have at least three Independent Directors who constitute more than half of the total number of Directors."
Samsung_55,"Independence and Transparency of the Board Since 2018, the position of CEO and Chairman of the Board have been separated in order to ensure stronger independence and transparency. In 2020, we appointed an Independent Director as Chairman of the Board to reinforce responsible management centered around the Board of Directors and to further improve our corporate governance. The Chairman of the Board listens to the opinions of the Executive Directors and the Independent Directors and functions as a mediator so that the company's management may be overseen and supervised more objec - tively. The Independent Directors hold separate meetings where they can freely exchange their opinions on a wide range of business matters, including on how to enhance value for shareholders. Appointment and Terms of Directors Directors are appointed by a resolution of a general meeting of share-holders in accordance with Article 382 of the Commercial Act."
Samsung_60,"Accord-ing to Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act, Executive Directors are elected among the candidates recommended by the Board, while Independent Directors are named among the candidates endorsed by the Independent Director Recommendation Committee. According to the same Article, the majority of the Independent Director Recom-mendation Committee must be composed of Independent Directors. Following the Article, our Independent Director Recommendation Committee consists entirely of Independent Directors and nominates candidates through fair procedures. The term of a Director’s appoint - ment is three years, and a Director can be reappointed by the vote of a general meeting of shareholders at the expiration of the term. How - ever, the total term is limited to six years by the Commercial Act.Expertise and Diversity of the Board We believe a Board with a diverse array of skills and expertise is a powerful enabler in making important strategic decisions in a rap-idly changing business environment."
Samsung_65,"Our three main business divi - sions - Consumer Electronics (CE), IT & Mobile Communications (IM), and Device Solutions (DS) - are run by our best experts in the field, who participate in the Board's activities as both CEOs and Executive Directors to practice responsible management.We seek to form the Board of Directors by considering racial, gender, religious, regional, and national diversities. Our Independent Direc - tors are appointed from various fields, including finance, law, engi-neering, IT, public administration, and EHS. They are chosen regard-less of their nationality or gender.

Board Meetings The Board meeting is called by the Chairman, who notifies all Direc - tors of the date, time, location, and agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, as required by Article 30 of the Articles of Incorpora-tion and Article 8 of the Board of Directors Regulations."
Samsung_70,"Each Direc - tor has the authority to request the Chairman to convene a meeting for reasons deemed necessary after sharing the agenda item and the reason behind the request. If the Chairman rejects a request for a meeting without a valid reason, the Director who made the request may convene a meeting directly. Board Decisions Pursuant to Article 31 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 9 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, a resolution of the Board is approved by a majority vote cast by the Directors present at the meeting, with more than half of all the Directors present, unless oth-erwise stated in the relevant laws. In accordance with Article 391 of the Commercial Act, the Board of Directors may hold a meeting by using a remote communications device that allows simultaneous transmission and reception of the voices of all Directors.To avoid any potential conflicts of interest, we restrict the voting rights of any Director who has a personal interest in any agenda items under Article 9 of the Board of Directors Regulations. Board Committees   The Board of Directors delegates specific responsibilities to six com - mittees to ensure efficient operation in accordance with Article 28-2 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 11-2 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors."
Samsung_75,"The six committees are the Management Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Gover - nance Committee, Independent Director Recommendation Commit - tee, and Related Party Transactions Committee. The Management Committee is composed of five Executive Direc - tors, to whom the Board of Directors has delegated authorities for the purpose of making prompt decisions on business matters. The other five committees are composed entirely of Independent Direc - tors in order to ensure their independence. The organization, oper - ation, and authority of each committee are set forth in the Regula-tions of the Committees approved by the Board. All Directors are notified about any agenda passed by a Board Com - mittee in two days."

The Board gives serious consideration  to how these matters should be addressed  to enhance corporate value  over the long term."
Samsung_85,"""Jae-Wan Bahk,  Chairman of the Board 6 Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report 2021Compliance & Ethics Compliance Management At Samsung Electronics, compliance with laws and ethical standards  is the top priority among our business principles. As a leading global company, we strive to conduct our business in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to practice ethical management. We continually work to establish and strengthen compliance man - agement across the organization. We also have dedicated teams at  each business division and regional offices across the globe to man-age specific compliance issues in each respective business sector and region. Furthermore, relevant departments work together in var - ious fields, including fair trade, intellectual property rights, personal information and privacy, labor and human rights, and environmental safety, to support compliance activities and manage potential risks."
Samsung_90,"Samsung Electronics operates the three-step compliance manage - ment process, consisting of prevention, detection, and response, which we work to continually improve. We have also implemented the Compliance Program Management System (CPMS), an IT system that enables efficient management of compliance tasks. At the prevention stage, we provide employees with detailed compli- ance policies and guidelines via CPMS for reference when perform - ing their tasks. We evaluate regulatory trends to reduce legal risks and provide training programs for employees based on our findings. If employees have questions or require assistance determining the legality of specific matters based on the guidelines, they can seek one-on-one consultation with experts at the help desk on CPMS."
Samsung_95,"At the detection phase, we conduct annual compliance audits and  report the results to the Board of Directors at least once a year. Furthermore, we have established a whistle-blowing system through which violations of law can be reported, and in accordance with our compliance control standard, we protect whistleblowers’ identities and prohibit any unfair treatment of whistleblowers. At the response phase, we devise ways to prevent recurrences of  compliance violations by improving the process based on our anal - ysis of the compliance audit results as well as the reporting and response results. In case of any violations, we undertake corrective measures including disciplinary measures or education according to our internal rules. We continually update our compliance management by regular legal  risk assessments."

Strengthened the Compliance Officer’s Independence and Authority  The Compliance Team, which previously reported to the Corporate Legal Office, is now directly overseen by  the CEO, and the compliance control standard has been updated to strengthen the Compliance Officer's independence and authority. The standard requires that a specific reason be cited when terminating the Compliance Officer in order to prevent any unfair disadvantage in personnel matters for reasons related to performing duties. Additionally, when conducting compliance activities, the Compliance Team has the authority to request resources from relevant teams, including personnel support as well as financial resources."
Samsung_105,"The Compliance Officer has the right to attend all Board meetings, right to make a statement, and the right to call for a Board meeting, strengthening all authority related to Board meetings. Accord-ingly, the Compliance Officer attends all Board meetings and the Management Committee’s meetings to ensure lawful decision-making in compliance with the regulations. 2. Reinforced Reporting Violation of Law   In 2020, in addition to the in-house reporting system in CPMS, we created a new reporting channel that accepts anonymous reports about violation of law from external stakeholders and disclosed the e-mail address, phone number, and fax number for reporting, which has enhanced the effectiveness of the report - ing system. 3."
Samsung_110,"Intensified Compliance Management for Anti-Corruption  Updating the Anti-Corruption Policy and Detailed Guidelines    We updated our 'Global Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy' in 2020, reflecting our commitment to com - plying with all domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws as well as conducting our business practices in an ethical manner.

All reports related to corruption are fact-checked through inspections and dealt with according to the severity of each case. The results are reported to the Audit Committee twice a year. We provide anti-corruption training in various formats to all employ - ees at least once a year."

The Committee consists of six external members including the Chairman and one internal member, and is led by Chairman Ji-Hyung Kim, a former Supreme Court Justice. The external members of the Committee were appointed based on their fields of expertise and experience in law, accounting, economics, administration, and other professional fields in corporate compliance. 1) Samsung Electronics, Samsung C&T, Samsung SDI, Samsung Electro-Mechanics,  Samsung SDS, Samsung Life Insurance, and Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance."
Samsung_125,"Key Activities of the Committee   The Committee holds monthly  regular meetings with compliance officers of Samsung's affiliated companies as well as additional meetings if necessary. 1) The Commit - tee reviews the affiliated companies’ external sponsorship expendi-tures and internal transactions and provides independent opinions. In addition, the Committee reviews report submissions on affiliated companies’ compliance violations by whistleblowers through mail, e-mail, and external agencies. On its homepage, the Committee dis-closes the meeting contents and its statements on the relevant dis-cussions. The Committee also engages in activities and events, including  roundtable discussion with the top management including affil - iate companies’ CEOs (January 2021), workshops to strengthen compliance management for companies’ compliance officers (July 2020), roundtable discussion on the corporate governance struc - ture with external experts (November 2020 and January 2021), and labor-management advisory group (April 2021)."
Samsung_130,"1) A total of 32 events held from February 2020 to January 2021. Implementation of the Committee’s Recommendations and Sug - gestions    Based on the Committee’s recommendations and sugges - tions on further improvements to our compliance management, we devise and instigate action plans. We formed a labor-management advisory group under the Board  of Directors and revised the policies to guarantee the three labor rights. Also, in order to engender the trust of civic organizations, we hold roundtable discussions between civic organization leaders and our company’s key executives. We also formed a compliance coun-cil with the affiliated companies and carry out quarterly meetings to reinforce the compliance system."

Samsung_1110,"After the special audit on forced labor in 2019, from January to April 2020, we visited 26 local suppliers to address the areas of vulnerabil - ities, and provided customized consulting.Grievance Resolution  We support suppliers in establishing and operating an internal grievance resolution process to facilitate communication between the management and employees. As an extension of this effort, we have been operating a direct hotline for all suppliers since 2013 to receive reports on suppliers' work environment or workers' rights issues. In local languages at workplaces, reports are submitted via landline, email, or mobile phone. Posters in local languages are also displayed including offices, hallways, manufacturing sites, dormito-ries, and cafeterias to provide guidance on the hotline. All grievances are inspected within seven days, and we give feedback to the griev - ant and track the status of corrective measures."
Samsung_1115,"In 2020, the most frequently reported complaints were regard - ing employees’ managers and wages, which we swiftly addressed  through appropriate training and reinforcement of communica-tion with suppliers. We have confirmed that improvements were made. In particular, we resolved an unpaid wage claim by a resigned employee, paying out the correct amount owed. This confirmed the effectiveness of our hotlines in addressing grievances and showed that it was an effective channel though which even resigned workers could easily access support. In addition, in order to establish a more reliable grievance process, we  collected opinions regarding improvement of the hotline from suppli-ers and conducted informant satisfactory surveys."
Samsung_1120,"The results found that the necessary measures were applied to all reports and they were handled while protecting the identity of the grievants. We will con-tinue to further improve this system by working with suppliers. Third Party Audit     Although COVID-19 posed considerable challenges in conducting audits in 2020, third-party audit results have found that suppliers’ compliance rate in 2020 was similar to that of last year and that efforts to improve the working environment were well in progress. Managing Ongoing Improvements   We require suppliers to provide detailed action plans to address the findings during the initial third-party audit and follow up on the status of required improvements and complete the closure audit. In cases where improvement measures on key areas take a prolonged period of time, we continually collaborate with suppliers to ensure that the necessary corrections are made."

Morgan Stanley_20,"OUR THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS5 MORGAN STANLEYIt has been an extremely challenging few months thus far in 2020. We are in   the midst of a global health crisis, and a period of great economic uncertainty. During this difficult time, the resilience of our team is more important than ever. I am proud that our employees are doing what they do best: supporting our   clients and our firm, and helping their loved ones and communities through the   physical and mental stress of this crisis. I know that together we can support   one another in navigating these challenges."
Morgan Stanley_25,"While it’s only April 2020, the year of 2019 feels very distant. Looking back, throughout 2019, sustainable investing gained  momentum. Mainstream investment managers and large corporations stepped forward with bold statements and long-term  commitments. 2019 ended with Time Magazine naming a young climate activist as its person of the year. 2020 kicked off with  climate change and sustainable investing as central themes at Davos."
Morgan Stanley_30,"When the global pandemic hit, we turned our energy toward taking care of our employees, our clients and our communities. It is a  challenging time unlike any we have seen, but as a firm we are strong, and we will come through this. When we do, our commitment  to our communities for a more sustainable world will be more important than ever. As I reflect on what we achieved in 2019, I am reassured that the fundamentals of Morgan Stanley’s business strategy continue to  prioritize long-term value creation, earnings stability and a strong, inclusive and ethical culture. This approach is core to everything  we do, including our efforts built over the past decade to integrate sustainability considerations across our firm."
Morgan Stanley_35,"Notably, we became the first bank to embark on activities across the value chain to reduce plastic waste, announcing the  Morgan Stanley Plastic Waste Resolution  in April 2019. While we benefit from the innovative products and services that plastics  enable throughout our lives, including vital diagnostic and medical equipment, excessive plastic waste takes an environmental and  economic toll. By partnering with our clients as well as nonprofits and academic institutions, we have pledged to facilitate the  prevention, reduction and removal of 50 million metric tons of plastic waste by 2030. This commitment maintains that plastic can  offer many important benefits, while also seeking to reduce plastic waste from entering the natural environment and ecosystems. In 2019, we hosted our inaugural Sustainable Investing Summit."
Morgan Stanley_40,"The successful event, which was attended by more than 100 clients,  demonstrated our truly integrated approach and commitment to sustainability. Every day our professionals are focused on bringing  tangible impacts to our sustainable investing initiatives, which include everything from issuing green bonds in capital markets, to  impact investing for Wealth Management clients, to innovative Investment Management strategies. The risks and opportunities of climate change have become more apparent. We believe having a sustainable planet is foundational  to having a healthy society and sound financial system. Morgan Stanley seeks to support the transition to a low-carbon economy  through products and services, business activities, and actionable analysis for investors."

Helping Portfolio Companies Tackle Plastic Waste    In support of Morgan Stanley’s new commitment to reduce plastic  waste, MSIM is engaging more with portfolio companies on this  critical topic. In 2019, the International Equity  team met with 11 of its fast-moving  consumer goods sector (FMCG) holdings, including beverages,  household and personal care companies, to discuss plastic waste. While there is no single solution, the most practical near-term  solution for FMCG companies is increasing the proportion of  recycled content in their packaging and reducing the overall amount  of packaging. Most of the team’s holdings with exposure to plastic  packaging have now publicly committed to significantly increase  recycled content, from less than 10% in most cases to 20–50% by  2025–30."
Morgan Stanley_250,"Direct engagement helped inform the team’s research  and analysis of whether this issue represents a material risk to the  sustainability of returns on operating capital of its FMCG holdings. Our Counterpoint Global  team has convened corporate, academic  and NGO experts to explore solutions to marine plastic waste. Through this process, the team identified a global coffee retailer in  its portfolio with disproportionate brand risk exposure. With our  support, the company announced plans and targets to minimize its  single-use-plastic footprint and collaborate with competitors to  create sustainable packaging. 2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT24 MORGAN STANLEYESG INTEGRATION IN ACTION: FIXED INCOME ESG CREDIT  SCORING FRAMEWORK The MSIM Fixed Income team has established a unique scoring  model for evaluating ESG factors in corporate credit."
Morgan Stanley_255,"ESG  research is not typically designed for fixed income investors. As a result, the MSIM fixed income team created a proprietary  ESG-scoring methodology that explicitly considers the risks  and opportunities ESG factors pose to corporate bonds. Built  on deep knowledge as sector specialists, the credit analysts  complement their investment expertise with ESG-focused  research from an array of leading third-party sources to derive  sector risk weightings across 47 sub-sectors. The team’s view  is that companies should be rewarded for demonstrating a  willingness to change and adopt stronger ESG principles. To  account for momentum in the scoring methodology, the team  makes numerical adjustments to third-party data in favor of  companies that demonstrate positive ESG momentum and  against companies that demonstrate negative momentum."
Morgan Stanley_260,"A similar adjustment is made for ESG-related controversies. The resulting blended score provides a meaningful input for  fixed income investors, allows for comparison across sectors  and measures long-term risk. In 2019, the model was integrated  into the fundamental investment analysis framework for all  corporate credit research across MSIM.

The new ESG Income  strategy excludes entities on the Carbon Underground 200 as  well as corporations that derive revenue from landmines and  cluster munitions, firearms, thermal coal or coal-fired power  generation and tobacco. It integrates ESG as follows:  •  Corporate Credit:  Proprietary ESG scoring model that   applies ESG controversy and momentum tilts and sector   risk overlays. •  Sovereign:  Embeds issues such as press freedom, political  and social stability, environmental concerns, corruption, and  rule of law into the team’s fundamental country analysis  framework. •  Securitized:  Proprietary rating system scores each security  on ESG factors such as the environmental impact of  underlying loans or assets and the extent to which they  promote financial inclusion and fair lending practices."
Morgan Stanley_275,"Inform in Action: Thought Leadership on   Climate Risk and Opportunity  In 2019, MSIM investment teams deepened their focus on climate  risk and how it impacts investing. For example, the AIP Private Markets business authored   Debunking Six Myths About Climate Investing . The paper  identified the investable opportunity to address climate change  as much broader than renewable energy and clean tech. AIP’s  Private Markets business demonstrates this in practice by creating  measurable climate solutions across multiple sectors—energy,  food, agriculture and chemicals. The team’s investments also   align with the SDGs."
Morgan Stanley_280,"Separate research published by the Global Balanced Risk  Control Strategy team highlighted Three Climate Tipping Points  Shaping Markets . The analysis demonstrated how government  and regulatory intervention is imminent, climate inaction is  undermining social stability and the dropping cost of renewable  energy makes it harder for markets to ignore   the benefits of low-carbon transition.2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT26 MORGAN STANLEY Community Development Finance Morgan Stanley also brings together investment and  philanthropic and private capital to create lasting positive  changes in communities across the United States. Our U.S.  banks have consistently received “Outstanding” ratings   from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),  including most recently in 2019, for their track records in  meeting community needs. Our Community Development Finance (CDF) group executes  new and innovative transactions not routinely provided by  private investors. Designed and implemented with community  and nonprofit partners, our program seeks to transform  people’s quality of life through a focus on: •  Preservation and development of sustainable, multifamily  affordable rental housing •  Healthy communities  •  Equitable transit-oriented development  •  Economic development that supports quality jobs  •  Capital for underserved, small and rural markets  •  Capacity building for nonprofits."

Since 2014, when  Morgan Stanley launched its private   equity funds to preserve affordable  multifamily rental housing, the firm has  committed to invest $955MM in private  equity funds that achieve this goal,  including more than $500MM in 2019. Connecting Affordable Housing to  Transit:  We support initiatives that   lower the cost burden of transportation  for low-income people and improve  public transit access, which in turn helps  reduce dependence on cars. In 2019, we  helped finance the Utah Equitable Transit  Oriented Development Fund, which will  develop and acquire multifamily rental  units and for-sale housing located within  a half mile of transit sites in the fastest- growing state in the country. Supporting Community Health:    We continued to invest in community  health through the Healthy Futures Fund  (HFF)."
Morgan Stanley_290,"Created in partnership with the  Local Initiatives Support Corporation  (LISC) and The Kresge Foundation,  Morgan Stanley provides capital through  HFF to expand healthcare access by co- locating quality primary care clinics and  affordable housing. In 2019, we invested  $18.5MM in Stanton Square, Washington,  D.C., which will construct 121 affordable  homes alongside a Morgan Stanley  financed community health center.Catalyzing Community Development  Finance:  In 2019, we continued to   drive change in the financing market  for Community Development Finance  Institutions (CDFIs). Specifically,  Morgan Stanley structured and  marketed a groundbreaking $100 million  sustainability bond issuance for the Low  Income Investment Fund (LIIF). The bond  is a CDFI sector first, aligning directly   with eight of the SDGs: SDG 1 , SDG 2 ,  SDG 3 , SDG4 , SDG 8 , SDG 9 , SDG 10   and SDG 11 . LIIF was the fifth U.S. CDFI  to issue debt through the public capital  markets, with Morgan Stanley managing  three of these offerings, including the  sector inaugural issuance in 2017.Funding Residents’ Services:  In 2019,  we committed to expand our unique  funding program for resident services  in affordable housing properties  nationally."
Morgan Stanley_295,"This follows the success of a  pilot program related to our efforts to  renovate, and keep affordable, severely  distressed buildings in New York City. Residents of these properties, or their  surrounding communities, receive diverse  services that improve daily life. Examples  include: a garden manager who helps  residents grow healthy foods, free  financial and college counseling, aging-   in-place and wellness programs for  seniors, and arts activities. Responding to Natural Disasters:    When extreme weather strikes, affordable  housing shortages can be exacerbated  in affected towns and cities. We help  communities rebuild after disasters,  focusing in 2019 on the aftermath of  the California wildfires."
Morgan Stanley_300,"Our experts  helped lead taskforces of nonprofits and  stakeholders in devastated communities. As an example, in 2019, two of our  financings helped create almost 80  affordable apartment units for low- and  moderate-income families in Sonoma  County, at a time of extreme shortage. 2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT28 MORGAN STANLEYThe Institute for Sustainable  Investing    Chaired by the firm’s CEO and Chairman, James Gorman, an  advisory board of prominent leaders from business, academia  and leading nongovernmental organizations guides the   Institute’s priorities.

Hosted by   James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s Chairman and CEO, the event  convened more than 100 leading sustainable finance thinkers   and practitioners across the value chain. Institutional investors,   asset owners, corporate financial leaders and high net worth   individual investors came together to discuss the innovation and   ideas reshaping capital markets. The event featured speakers   from the Institute’s advisory board, Morgan Stanley’s Operating   Committee, and financial and business leaders across public   and private markets."
Morgan Stanley_315,"Sustainable Signals:  Growth and Opportunity in Asset Management  Executive Summary Sustainable investing has gone mainstream in the United States. A new survey  reveals that asset managers now view sustainable investing as a strategic business  imperative. Asset managers surveyed foresee a rosy outlook for both client  demand and competitive returns, and will continue to build their sustainable  investing capabilities and product portfolios in the coming years. This survey by the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing and Bloomberg highlights the growth,  direction and future outlook of sustainable investing among U.S. asset managers. It builds on a survey and  interview series first conducted in 2016."

It has helped transform sectors as wide-ranging as health care,  transportation, packaging and electronics. Over the last few years, however, the   public has grown increasingly aware of the impact of plastic waste. Changing  consumer preferences and increased regulation are driving companies to better  measure and manage their plastic footprints. Meanwhile, valuable raw materials  worth billions of dollars are discarded each year due to inefficiencies in design,  collection and recycling of products containing plastic."
Morgan Stanley_325,"While it remains a nascent  investment theme, the ubiquity of plastic, and the growing trend to reduce the   impact of plastic waste, warrants a closer look from the investment community. Plastics are durable, malleable, multifunctional materials   with low-cost, high-volume production methods. These traits  have helped drive a massive increase in plastic use since  production began in earnest following World War II. Primary  plastic production has increased more than 20-fold since  the 1960s,1 to 407 million metric tons in 2015.2 Production has grown so quickly, in fact, that virtually half of all plastics  ever produced were manufactured within the last 15 years.3  As populations grow, poverty rates decline and consumption  rates increase—particularly in emerging economies—plastic  production is forecast to outpace global economic growth by   a multiplier of 1.2 to 1.5.4Plastic Waste:   Addressing a Global Economic and Environmental  Challenge Through the Power of the Capital Markets Sustainable Signals: Growth and  Opportunity in Asset Management   provided the latest data on the continued  growth of sustainable investing among   U.S .asset managers, with 75% of firms   now practicing sustainable investing.Plastic Waste: Addressing a Global  Economic and Environmental Challenge  Through the Power of the Capital Markets   highlighted the groundswell of interest in  and investment considerations for plastic  waste as a nascent investment theme.

Morgan Stanley_330,"It found that  there is no financial trade-off between the  returns of sustainable funds and traditional  funds, and that sustainable funds may   offer lower market risk. In April 2019, Morgan Stanley became the first financial  services firm to commit to developing systemic solutions  to help address the growing challenge of plastic waste. Through the speed, scale and innovation of the capital  markets, and by partnering with our clients, employees and   non-profits, the Morgan Stanley Plastic Waste Resolution  aims to prevent, reduce and remove 50 million metric tons  of plastic waste from entering rivers, oceans, landscapes  and landfills by 2030. As investors show growing interest in committing capital to solve  environmental challenges, blue bonds have emerged as the latest financing  instrument to help protect the world’s oceans and the economies that  rely on their health.

Depending on the results of the ESRM  review, transactions may be escalated to our Regional and  Global Franchise Committees and to senior management. For example, we were invited to execute a transaction for an  integrated steel-producing company with steel, mining and  energy operations."
Morgan Stanley_410,"We engaged in enhanced due diligence  with the company to review its Environmental Health and  Safety (EHS) Management framework, its approach to tailings  dam management and its engagement with stakeholders. The  company is very focused on environmental and social risk  management; in particular, its EHS Management System has  been certified in accordance with ISO 14001 standards, and  is further supported by open communication of concerns by  its employees and communities. With respect to its tailings  dam management, the company has retained independent experts to assess the stability of its dams, conducts emergency  preparedness exercise and has put in place robust controls. Finally, the company has undertaken a number of initiatives to  address local community concerns. On the basis of this enhanced  due diligence, we approved moving forward with the transaction."
Morgan Stanley_415,"In another case, we were asked by a client to advise on the  potential acquisition of a technology company. The technology  company had been the subject of much controversy regarding  the use of its technology and potential human rights violations.

Morgan Stanley_465,"The Board of Directors is engaged in human capital and culture  oversight. Our Board and its CMDS Committee periodically  review management succession plans that include, among other  things, an assessment of the experience, performance and skills  of potential successors to our Chairman and CEO. More broadly,  the Board, including the CMDS Committee, is regularly updated  and consulted on key talent hires as well as the firm’s human  capital strategy. This strategy is continuously refined based on  business drivers, employee surveys and the overall environment  for talent. CULTURE  Morgan Stanley employees are our main asset."
Morgan Stanley_470,"Our core values  guide decision making aligned to the expectations of our clients,  shareholders, regulators and directors, and the public. These  guiding values—Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing,  Leading With Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back—are at the   heart of our strong workplace culture and underpin our success. Maintaining a strong employee culture is the focus of our   Culture, Values and Conduct Committee of senior managers,   with oversight from the Board of Directors. Our Code of Conduct    is central to this program. Every new hire, and every employee  annually, is required to certify that they understand and  will follow its provisions on ethical behavior."
Morgan Stanley_475,"To reinforce its  messages, we invite new recruits to attend culture panels with  senior leaders in each region. Our executives also lead   mandatory firmwide culture conversations. We invite employee feedback on our culture and workplace  through an employee survey. In 2019, 91% of employees  responded, with 88% stating they were proud to work for  Morgan Stanley. A significant majority were comfortable raising  a risk, concern or unethical/inappropriate situation with their  manager."

PRIORITIZING DIVERSITY AND TALENT  Recruiting a highly diverse workforce and fostering an inclusive  work environment is not only the right thing to do; it is also  good for our business. To this end, we pursue a comprehensive  diversity and inclusion (D&I) strategy based on four pillars:  accountability, representation, advancement and culture. Driving awareness of, and accountability for, D&I efforts   among managers across our businesses is key to making  progress."

Morgan Stanley_500,"Advancing Pay Equity   Amid growing evidence that diverse organizations often  outperform their peers, we employ policies and practices,  including those on pay, that help attract, retain and advance  underrepresented talent. To promote equitable rewards for all  employees, including women and ethnically diverse employees,  we have enhanced: •  Robust practices to support fair and consistent compensation  and reward decisions based on merit  •  Ongoing review of compensation decisions, including at the  point of hire and promotion  •  Regular assessment of our rewards structure.

Our performance, pay, promotion and succession  processes are designed to engage and reward talented and  committed individuals while reinforcing our culture and values. Annual employee evaluations include feedback from managers  and colleagues on overall performance, conduct, risk behavior  and culture. This input is then factored into compensation and  promotion decisions, aligning an employee’s demonstrated  behavior with his or her rewards."
Morgan Stanley_525,"Balancing Risk and Reward  We pursue responsible and effective compensation programs  that reinforce our values and culture through four key  objectives: delivering pay for sustainable performance,  attracting and retaining top talent, aligning with shareholder  interests and mitigating excessive risk-taking. The Board’s  CMDS Committee oversees the firm’s incentive compensation  arrangements in line with these objectives. Together with   senior management, the CMDS Committee oversees: •   Policies for funding and allocating incentive compensation,  and the use of discretion in determining individual incentive  compensation awards. •   Processes for identifying “material risk taker” employees. •   Controls to mitigate the risk of rewarding inappropriate  conduct and unsatisfactory performance."
Morgan Stanley_530,"•   Processes to administer incentive compensation clawback   and cancellation features. In 2019, on average, 62% of total remuneration was variable  for material risk takers, of which 55% was subject to malus or  clawback provisions. Where we uncover conduct contrary to our policies, disciplinary  action may include cancellation and clawback of compensation,  changes to promotion decisions or termination of employment. In our 2019 employee survey, 80% of respondents agreed  there should be personal consequences for those who do not  demonstrate the firm’s values.SUPPORTING WELLNESS   Health at Morgan Stanley  Doing the right thing by our employees and their families   includes offering comprehensive health benefits and resources. Benefits vary by country and can include: medical, dental and  vision coverage; tax-advantaged flexible spending and health  savings accounts; and critical illness, accident, disability and   life insurance."
Morgan Stanley_535,"Our Chief Medical Officer leads our global health care and  employee benefits strategy. We partner with leading health and  family-care providers to deliver holistic services that meet our  people’s varied needs. In 2019, we expanded fertility, adoption  and surrogacy benefits for U.S. employees, making it easier for  everyone seeking treatment to be covered, including those who  are single or in same-sex relationships. Resources for working parents include center-based and in-home  backup care, along with help finding caregivers and discounts  on daycare and preschool. In the U.K., we also offer a workplace  nursery close to our London office."

Morgan Stanley_630,"Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investing in the market entails risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments may increase or decrease over varying time periods. Equity  securities’ prices may fluctuate in response to specific situations for each company, industry, market condition and general economic environment. Companies  paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time."
Morgan Stanley_635,"Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond’s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the  maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. International investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing."
Morgan Stanley_640,"These risks include political and economic  uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets, since these countries  may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economics. REITs’ investing risks are similar to those associated with direct  investments in real estate; lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions. Please note that there is currently no standard definition of “green bond.” Without limiting any of the statements contained herein, Morgan Stanley  Smith Barney LLC makes no representation or warranty as to whether this bond constitutes a green bond or conforms to investor expectations or objectives  for investing in green bonds.

Morgan Stanley_645,"Alternative investments often are speculative and include a high degree of risk. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. Alternative investments are suitable only for eligible, long-term investors who are willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. They may be highly illiquid and can engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase the volatility and risk of loss. Alternative investments  typically have higher fees than traditional investments."
Morgan Stanley_650,"Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing. Private Funds (which include hedge funds are private equity funds) often engage in speculative investment techniques and are only suitable for long-term,  qualified investors. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. They are generally illiquid, not tax efficient and have higher fees than  many traditional investments. The investor should note that funds that invest exclusively in one sector or industry involve additional risks."
Morgan Stanley_655,"The lack of industry diversification subjects the  investor to increased industry-specific risks. Investment returns will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than original cost. Investors should carefully  consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of a mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) before investing. To obtain  a prospectus, contact your Financial Advisor or visit the fund company’s website. The prospectus contains this and other information about the mutual  fund or ETF."
Morgan Stanley_660,"Read the prospectus carefully before investing. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) aware investments or sustainable investments may be lower  or higher than a portfolio that is more diversified or where decisions are based solely on investment considerations. Because ESG or sustainability criteria  exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria.

This understanding is core to our approach to sustainable  finance, which is grounded in two key pillars — inclusive growth and climate transition — that we apply to our work with  clients and our business. At the same time that the business case for sustainable growth has crystallized, the consequences of inaction have also  become more apparent. This is a rare moment where the pull of opportunity, and the push of risk, are driving market  participants in the same direction, toward sustainable growth. While we have been engaged in sustainable finance for the better part of two decades, 2019 represents a notable surge   in momentum."
Goldman Sachs_5,"During the year, we announced the formation of the Sustainable Finance Group to drive our efforts across   our businesses. Our ambitions in this area are sizable. We have set a target of $750 billion in financing, advisory and  investing activity over the next 10 years across these themes of climate transition and inclusive growth. As significantly,   we are weaving these capabilities across the firm, encompassing both how our divisions serve our clients and how we  manage ourselves as an organization. Sustainable finance was front and center across our client interactions in 2019."
Goldman Sachs_10,"We will go deeper into several examples   in the pages that follow, but a few examples are worth highlighting here. We worked with Enel to issue the first-ever general  corporate purpose bond that links the payment of its coupon to the company’s goal of generating at least 55 percent of its  power from renewables by the end of 2021 . We created a new corporate cash management solution that prioritizes business  with diverse broker-dealers. And we established a new policy to only take public those companies in the US and Europe with  at least one diverse board director (starting next year, we will increase our target to two). We also continued to deepen the  integration of sustainable finance within our core work, from how we make and manage private equity investments, to how  we steward assets as an active shareholder."
Goldman Sachs_15,"Sustainable finance has been a powerful application of our One Goldman Sachs  approach — mobilizing our best thinking across the firm on central questions for some of our largest clients. This report arrives in the midst of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has already  had a devastating impact on societies around the world. We have seen historic  levels of jobless claims, record volatility in the markets, and unprecedented  disruption to all aspects of our day-to-day lives. While so much remains  uncertain about the course of the virus, what is clear is that we will be dealing  with its effects for many months, and likely much longer."

That starts with  our support of our people and extends to fostering an inclusive environment where all of our colleagues can achieve  their goals. In 2019, we adopted new policies to drive diverse hiring at all seniority levels and to support working parents,  including by increasing parental leave to 20 weeks for all employees. Through these initiatives, we are reaffirming our  belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to the long-term success of Goldman Sachs. Managing the firm sustainably also means a continued focus on the efficiency of our operations, taking care to reduce  our environmental impact over time."

Goldman Sachs_30,"For small businesses, we developed a $525 million Small  Business Stimulus Package that includes $500 million to   provide emergency loans to small businesses across the US,   and $25 million in grants to Community Development Financial  Institutions (CDFIs) and other mission-driven lenders. For frontline medical teams, we have donated across the US  and Europe over 2.5 million surgical masks and 700,000 N-95  masks — which we acquired over a number of years following  prior epidemics like SARS, as part of our operational risk  management efforts.

As a result, an equal emphasis needs to be  placed on climate resiliency and adaptation,  which is the focus of a $700 million  bond issuance by the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)."
Goldman Sachs_70,"Goldman Sachs has been at the forefront  in developing catastrophe bonds, which are  debt instruments designed to raise money  in the event of natural disasters, including  from extreme weather events. From there, it was a natural step to the development  of the first resiliency bond, a new category  of green bond based on a set of climate  resilience principles established by the  Climate Bonds Initiative, an international  organization that is mobilizing the bond  market to support a low-carbon and climate- resilient economy. The offering is an outgrowth of a 2018  Climate Bonds Initiative meeting that  brought together experts in resilience and  climate adaptation. As a result, principles  around these issues were added to existing  standards and certification criteria, which  the Initiative had been applying to green  bonds since 2015. Goldman Sachs served  on the advisory board and helped develop  the principles."
Goldman Sachs_75,"Goldman Sachs has been a leader in the development of innovative financing approaches that drive capital  toward green and social projects. The past year’s activity had a number of notable firsts, including those that  provide new solutions that can be scaled across the market. Working with Enel, an Italian-headquartered energy company, Goldman  Sachs structured the first sustainability performance bond linked to the United  Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rather than restrict the use   of proceeds to specific green projects, the bond ties Enel’s cost of capital to   its strategic commitment to make installed capacity 55% renewable by the end  of 2021 — core to the company’s broader decarbonization strategy, including  its long-term goal of net-zero emissions. Under the bond’s performance-based  covenant, investors receive a step up in interest rates if the target is not met."
Goldman Sachs_80,"Issued in September 2019, Enel’s $1 .5 billion inaugural SDG-linked bond was  preceded by robust discussions with investors on the innovative structure,  and followed in October by a €2.5 billion similar offering. Enel has operations  in 33 countries on five continents. It manages 46 gigawatts of capacity from  renewable sources and supplies 70 million customers worldwide. INNOVATIVE APPROACH   TO FINANCING CLIMATE TRANSITION FIRST BOND BASED ON  CLIMATE RESILIENCE THE FIRST SDG -LINKED BOND Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition12 Innovative Approach to Financing Climate Transition (continued) The mission of The Conservation Fund is to accelerate land conservation in ways that make  both environmental and economic sense. The Conservation Fund was formed in 1985 to help  public agencies and local communities in the United States achieve permanent protection of land  and water resources with interim capital and technical expertise."
Goldman Sachs_85,"In 2019, Goldman Sachs helped issue a $150 million green bond for The Conservation Fund — the  first such nonprofit to issue a green bond to solely fund permanent land conservation. The proceeds  will be dedicated to scaling efforts to protect some 5 million acres of the nation’s working forests,  mitigating climate change, protecting ecosystems and strengthening rural communities.FIRST GREEN  BOND FOR US  CONSERVATIONGoldman Sachs facilitated climate-focused green   and sustainability bond issuances for two of the largest  companies in the world — PepsiCo and Sysco. PepsiCo’s first-ever green bond aims to support  decarbonizing the company’s global operations and supply  chain and investing in advanced packaging and water  sustainability. The $1 billion issuance that we helped  underwrite in 2019 drew strong market support, with  growing investor interest in ESG-linked securities. PepsiCo  intends to use the proceeds to pursue a wide range   of initiatives, including greater use of renewable energy,   water replenishment in high-water-risk regions, and  investments in sustainable product packaging.Sysco, the international food distributor, became   the second US company to issue a sustainability   bond, which allocates proceeds to both green and  social projects."
Goldman Sachs_90,"In February 2020, we structured   a $1 billion issuance for Sysco, which included   $500 million in sustainability bonds. The sustainability  bond portion will support a wide range of initiatives,  including procurement of sustainably harvested   food, investments in more sustainable water  management, and sourcing clean energy, as the  company seeks to use renewable sources through  long-term power purchase agreements for a portion   of its energy needs.

AES Gener will use the proceeds to continue the  transition to a more sustainable energy matrix by  increasing its base of renewable power projects. AES Gener is making this transition according to   its Greentegra strategy, with the goal of becoming  South America’s energy supplier of choice by  decarbonizing its customers’ electric supply through  long-term renewable power purchasing agreements  and reducing the carbon intensity of its portfolio."
Goldman Sachs_95,"This includes aggressive development of a wide   range of renewable energy projects, including   hydro, wind, solar and advanced battery energy  storage technology. In 2019, we created the first Green European  Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security —   River Green Finance 2020 — a green bond  that enables companies to tap capital markets  based on the sustainable aspects of their  collateral. In this case, the asset is River  Ouest, a 690,000-square-foot office building  in the western suburbs of Paris with a “very  good” rating from BREEAM, a sustainability  assessment method for rating buildings,  infrastructure and master planning projects. The  €186 million mortgage-backed issuance gives  asset managers the opportunity to invest in   a securitized product with green collateral.Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition14 Brightmark is a San Francisco–based global waste   solutions provider whose projects include turning  plastic waste into transport fuels and other useful  products. Through a $185 million financing Goldman Sachs  facilitated, Brightmark is building and plans to operate a  new Plastics Renewal plant in Ashley, Indiana, that will turn  100,000 tons of scrap plastic into 18 million gallons of   ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, naphtha blend stocks and nearly  6 million gallons of commercial-grade wax."
Goldman Sachs_100,"The company  will employ the process of pyrolysis, or plastics renewal,  which uses heating to decompose post-use plastic in   an environment with limited oxygen. This process is seen  as a key solution to both reducing petrochemical production  and plastic waste in markets around the world. Big River Steel, an advanced recycler and steelmaker   in northeast Arkansas, and the first steel producer in   the US that is LEED-certified, will use a $487 million  industrial bond offering structured by Goldman Sachs to  expand scrap metal recycling and production of flat-rolled  steel. This will set the stage for downstream investment,  including the production of higher-grade electrical steel,  demand for which is expected to grow as electric-vehicle  production ramps up. Big River Steel’s Flex Mill technology,  along with its focus on machine learning and data analytics,  allows it to produce some of the most demanding steel  grades at a competitive cost.Expansion of recycling and reuse is among the most important ways to fight climate change by limiting  dependence on new materials and reducing waste."
Goldman Sachs_105,"Whether through capital raising or direct investment, we  have helped drive the circular economy by enabling companies involved to innovate and scale operations.DEPLOYING CAPITAL   TO ADVANCE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMYGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition15We saw an under-addressed   market opportunity in small and mid-  sized commercial and industrial solar —   helping companies, cities, schools and hospitals  install solar on their rooftops. Based on our  assessment, the opportunity was a good fit for   our firm’s network of relationships, expertise in   risk management in energy markets, and strength   in evaluating and managing credit risk. From that  foundation, we formed the GSAM Renewable   Power Group, a team of roughly 35 experienced  professionals that invests in renewable energy  assets. This model allows us to partner with clients   to own and manage projects across the United  States that deliver clean energy, and in turn, to   sell the power produced by these assets under   long-term agreements to energy users. Currently, the GSAM Renewable Power Group   is among the largest owners and operators of distributed renewable generation assets in the United  States with over 1 gigawatt of operating capacity."
Goldman Sachs_110,"The  Group currently manages equity capital of approximately  $1 .9 billion, and expects to deploy approximately   $4 billion of total capital, including $500 million from   a green bond offering in December 2019. The GSAM Renewable Power Group partnered with  one of the largest solar developers, SunPower, to build  New York City’s largest solar project at JFK Airport. Once completed, the project will allow surrounding  communities to access solar energy at reduced rates. Besides reducing JFK’s greenhouse gas emissions   by approximately 7 ,000 tons annually (equivalent   to taking about 1,400 cars off the road), the project is  expected to lower the Port Authority’s greenhouse gas  emissions at the airport by around 10 percent The  GSAM Renewable Power Group will hold the power  purchase agreement for the project, while SunPower  will develop and construct the infrastructure at JFK. INVESTING TO SCALE   CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES   FUELING GROWTH IN   DISTRIBUTED POWER  In 2019, a fund managed by our Merchant Bank, alongside Volkswagen Group and BMW,   led a $1 billion equity capital raise for Northvolt, a Swedish supplier of sustainable, high-quality  lithium-ion battery cells and systems manufactured for the automotive, industrial and energy  storage sectors."
Goldman Sachs_115,"The capital raise underpinned the financing of the first 16 GWh of Northvolt’s first  gigafactory, which will be powered by 100% renewable electricity with plans for a co-located battery  recycling facility, which will deliver the world’s greenest lithium-ion battery with a minimal CO 2 footprint. Further supporting the equity financing and subsequent debt financing process, Northvolt  signed a number of supply agreements with a combined order value over $13 billion through  2030. In addition to the Swedish primary facility, Northvolt also formed a joint venture with  the Volkswagen Group to establish a 16 GWh battery cell gigafactory in Germany, which   will bring Volkswagen’s total investment in Northvolt to around $1 billion.POWERING A REVOLUTION IN BATTERY TECH Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition16 T wiga Foods is a Kenyan end-to-end distributor of fresh and processed food. Through Goldman   Sachs’ investment in the company, Twiga Foods is developing proprietary technology and logistical assets  to support its distribution system, which enables improved sustainability of the food and agriculture value  chain and allows farmers to be paid within 48 hours via mobile platforms. The investment is laying the  groundwork for expansion to cities across Africa, helping to drive sustainable access to lower-cost,   higher-quality food and improved economic security for farmers."
Goldman Sachs_120,"SUSTAINABLE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE FEEDING THE PLANET  SUSTAINABLY  DRIVING FOOD SECURITY Amid a growing focus on human health, climate change, resource  conservation and animal welfare, Goldman Sachs led the $277 million IPO   of Beyond Meat. Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in   the United States offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. Founded  in 2009, Beyond Meat has a mission of building meat directly from plants, an  innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other  sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying   the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating its plant-based meat   products. As of December 31, 2019, Beyond Meat’s portfolio of fresh and   frozen plant-based proteins was sold at approximately 77 ,000 retail, restaurant   and foodservice outlets in more than 65 countries worldwide.Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition17 DIFFERENTIATED ESG  INVESTING STRATEGIES Expanding the Opportunities  ESG and impact investments continue to gain momentum driven by rapidly  rising demand from institutional and individual investors. We continue to develop our capabilities in delivering  innovative and differentiated investment strategies, including those focused on renewable energy and  decarbonization."
Goldman Sachs_125,"At GSAM, ESG assets under supervision increased from $17 billion in December 2018 to   $74 billion in December 2019. In 2019, GSAM raised assets for an equity strategy that invests in companies focused on environmental  impact, with themes that range from renewable energy — including solar, wind, bioenergy and smart grid  services — to electric and autonomous vehicles and sustainable food production. The strategy assumes that, in fighting climate change, government-led approaches will undershoot key targets —  and that private sector innovation will be critical to meeting the climate challenge. It also assumes that companies  that successfully provide new solutions have significant upside, and that institutional and individual investors  seek the opportunity to take part in that potential. The strategy leverages our deep experience in ESG investment and our proprietary approach to weighing ESG  factors, risks and opportunities."
Goldman Sachs_130,"Recognizing that environmental factors can affect investment  performance and represent potential investment risk, GSAM has prioritized  engagement on climate change-related issues, including environmental  disclosure, climate risk and carbon reduction commitments.

Goldman Sachs_135,"Benchmarked to the  Russell 1000 index, the strategy relies on a carbon  emissions metric, developed jointly with the Fund, that  takes into account Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions —  those produced directly by the burning of fossil fuels   and indirectly by consuming electrical power. The San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System  (SFERS) sought to reduce its carbon footprint as  part of a broad strategy to address climate risk and  opportunities. GSAM enabled SFERS to develop a  framework for a multifaceted approach grounded in   the view that some oil & gas companies are better  positioned than others for the transition to a low-carbon  economy. The framework enables identification of high- risk fossil fuel assets, establishes a plan for engagement  where possible, and outlines options for targeted and  phased disinvestment of assets where there may be a  high unmitigated risk. Differentiated ESG Investing Strategies (continued) GSAM was an anchor investor  and partner in the Renewable  Resources Group’s Sustainable  Water Impact Fund (SWIF)."
Goldman Sachs_140,"Through  client commitments, GSAM was  able to provide over $300 million of  the SWIF’s $900+ million fundraise. Renewable Resources Group  launched SWIF in partnership with  The Nature Conservancy to invest in  portfolio companies that will improve  the management of surface water,  groundwater and farms to more  sustainably meet the water supply  needs of people, the environment and  the agricultural economy. The Nature  Conservancy is a technical advisor to  the Fund, helping to further enhance  sustainability benefits and support  habitat and ecosystem restoration  across the Fund’s properties.

In February 2020, Goldman Sachs  joined as a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), a policy organization representing the broadest  coalition on climate in the US supporting a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend plan as a pragmatic and efficient  solution for reducing GHG emissions and addressing climate change."
Goldman Sachs_145,"In December 2019, our CEO David Solomon also  published an editorial that underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and sustainable growth  and called for governments to put a price on the cost of carbon. Carbonomics, a report issued in December by Goldman Sachs Global  Investment Research, analyzes the cost curve of decarbonization through  almost 100 different technologies. The report identifies an abundance   of large, low-cost investment opportunities in power generation, industry,  transport, buildings and nature-based solutions that can support   $1–2 trillion dollars of decarbonization investments annually, creating   new jobs, higher energy security and lower pollution. Reducing net   carbon emissions quickly and effectively will demand a combination of  carbon pricing, technology and CO2 sequestration. The report describes   how capital markets already play a leading role by financing the energy  transition while reducing investments in hydrocarbon development,  fostering consolidation in a “new age of restraint” for the hydrocarbon  industry, and the evolution of large companies from Big Oil to Big Energy  as they become broader, cleaner energy providers.Carbon Pricing: A Market-Oriented Emissions  Reduction Strategy Goldman Sachs does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports."

Goldman Sachs_155,"However, these will not be sufﬁcient to   mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Reducing net carbon   emissions on this scale requires carbon pricing, technological   innovation and a growing role for CO2 sequestration. Capital markets  are taking a leading role in ﬁnancing the energy transition, while   tightening ﬁnancing for hydrocarbon assets. This is likely to drive the  energy transition through higher energy prices, lowering the systemic   risk of stranded assets. A new Age of Restraint on new hydrocarbon  developments is leading to consolidation and higher barriers to entry  in the oil & gas industry, with Big Oils transitioning to Big Energy and  non-OPEC oil supply growth terminating by 2021.CarbonomicsEQUITY RESEARCH | December 11, 2019 | 9:21PM GMT For the full list of authors, see inside.Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Accelerating the Climate Transition20 In addition to our work with clients, we continue to inform broader market approaches by leveraging  our insights through thought leadership and partnerships.ADVANCING THE ECOSYSTEM Underpinning the potential for broader scale and impact across inclusive growth and climate  transition themes is a need for good data."

Goldman Sachs was the first major US financial institution and the first global  investment bank to report under SASB standards in 2019 and GSAM is a long-standing member of the  SASB Alliance and SASB’s Investor Advisory Group. In 2019, GSAM teamed up with a select group of  other leading asset managers to advance climate- related investment among national sovereign wealth  funds (SWFs). Known as the One Planet Asset  Managers Initiative, this collaboration supports  the efforts of the One Planet SWF Working Group,  composed of leading SWFs, to drive a deeper  consideration of the impact of climate change on  investment portfolios. We believe that, while more  SWFs are incorporating sustainability into their  portfolios, broadening sets of investment options and  approaches can accelerate the trend, further bridging  the gap between policy and portfolio objectives.In January 2019, Goldman Sachs joined the CEO-led Climate Finance  Leadership Initiative (CFLI) as one of seven founding members alongside Allianz,  AXA, ENEL, GPIF , HSBC and Macquarie."

Mirroring this imbalance, lack of diversity is pronounced among venture   capital and private equity firms. Although diverse-owned firms are overrepresented in the top quartile of private equity groups,  diverse asset managers have less than 1 .3 percent of the $69 trillion of global assets under management.2 This imbalance is the impetus behind Launch With GS, a $500 million investment strategy grounded in our belief that diverse  teams drive strong returns. Launch With GS seeks to increase access to capital for women, black, Latinx, and other diverse  entrepreneurs and investors. Since its inception, Goldman Sachs has deployed more than $230 million to businesses with   diverse management teams globally — from a software provider in Atlanta, to a fintech company in Bengaluru and a pediatric  clinic in China."
Goldman Sachs_205,"In early 2020, Launch With GS announced Goldman Sachs’ first Black and Latinx Entrepreneur Cohort, which will be comprised   of a group of high-growth startups from across the United States. Beyond access to capital, these businesses will participate  in an eight-week virtual, customized experience that will include one-on-one and sector-specific workshops with our research,  banking and investment teams and interaction with startup experts across key areas including legal services, capitalization,  marketing and branding. Members of the Cohort will engage with the Goldman Sachs network, as well as the Launch With  GS Advisory Council, composed of leading entrepreneurs, investors and executives. The program will culminate in an Investor  Showcase, where entrepreneurs will introduce their companies to an invitation-only investor audience. LEVERAGING THE  STRENGTHS OF DIVERSE  ENTREPRENEURSHIPWe believe that diversity, in addition to being a social imperative, is also just good business."
Goldman Sachs_210,"Increased diversity of  experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation reduces the risk of groupthink and unlocks creative  and impactful solutions. This is why we are committed to driving diversity in our work with clients and have prioritized  having a diverse and inclusive workforce — including ambitious diversity goals for recruitment and hiring. 1 McKinsey, 2018. 2 Knight Foundation, 2019.Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Driving Inclusive Growth25 INCREASED FOCUS ON   BOARD DIVERSITY DRIVING BOARD DIVERSITY   AT THE STARTING GATEAdvancing Diversity and Inclusion — A Commercial Imperative (continued) Underscoring our conviction that diverse perspectives can have   a strong impact on company performance, we have prioritized board  diversity in our stewardship efforts. During the 2019 proxy season,   GSAM voted against 312 directors at 214 companies for lacking at  least one woman on the board."
Goldman Sachs_215,"In November 2019, GSAM contacted  approximately 50 companies in situations where votes were cast  against board members for lack of female representation. Through these  engagements, we sought information on each company’s approach to  recruiting diverse talent and the potential barriers to such recruitment. As an additional example of these efforts, GSAM made engagement  on board diversity a key feature in repositioning an $11 billion European  money market fund under its management. The fund, which also employs  an ESG alignment approach across various factors, has a dedicated  engagement focus with respect to board diversity. To encourage diversity,  the GSAM Stewardship Team assesses, engages and tracks progress in  portfolio companies with an underrepresentation of women on the board.In 2018, when GSAM repositioned  a money market fund focused on the  purchase of US government securities,  including treasuries and agencies,  the purpose was to drive diversity by  directing the fund’s trades, subject to  best execution, to diverse broker-dealers."
Goldman Sachs_220,"On average, during 2019, the fund used  diverse broker-dealers to buy approximately  half of its assets, simultaneously helping  these dealers to grow and enabling clients  to add a diversity-focused investment  solution to their portfolios. In 2019, the fund reached $1 .5 billion   in assets, drawing high-profile investors,  including one of America’s most prominent  companies: JetBlue. JetBlue was among  the first clients to join the repurposed  fund, leveraging it as a vehicle to expand  opportunities for underrepresented firms. Further underscoring our commitment to advancing diversity, we  announced that, effective July 2020, we will only underwrite IPOs  of companies domiciled in the US and Western Europe that have at  least one diverse board member. We will raise this target to two during  2021 ."
Goldman Sachs_225,"We strongly believe in the business case for diversity and that  having diverse perspectives on boards leads to better governance and  stronger company performance for our corporate clients. While we define diversity across multiple dimensions, one example   our CEO David Solomon cited as part of the announcement is that   the performance of public offerings of US companies with at least one  female director has significantly outperformed companies with no   female directors over the past four years. It is our responsibility as an advisor supporting our IPO clients to ensure  that their governance structure is setting them up for long-term success,  particularly as they transition to the public markets for the first time. We are actively working with our clients to help them achieve and  surpass these diversity targets by facilitating access to our extensive  network of diverse board candidates, which encompasses individuals  representing a broad definition of diversity, such as race, gender,  ethnicity and sexual orientation.

Goldman Sachs_230,"In 2019, we provided $88 million  in financing for South Point at Hunters Point South in Long Island City, NY, which is part of the  broader Hunters Point South, the largest affordable housing development created in New York  City since the 1970s. South Point consists of 1,132 units of mixed-income housing across two  buildings with 849 permanently affordable housing units for families earning between $32,000  and $128,000 a year. In addition, the project will be Enterprise Green Community–certified, using low-emissivity glass,  exhaust heat recovery systems, low-flow plumbing fixtures, and a water-sourced heat pump to  achieve 15 percent greater energy efficiency than required by the city code. In the Pacific Northwest, we made a private investment in and are providing a debt facility  to Sustainable Living Partners (SLP), a real estate technology venture aimed at sustainable,  affordable multifamily housing using a prefabricated building technology with a distinctly  green profile. SLP is the result of a joint venture between Sustainable Living Innovations  (SLI) of Seattle and Renova Capital Partners, a private equity firm specializing in sustainable  infrastructure."
Goldman Sachs_235,"SLI’s innovative construction process creates mid- and high-rise multifamily  buildings while incorporating features such as recycled steel trusses and energy-efficient, low- emission, reduced-water building systems. Furthermore, because building components arrive at  building sites preassembled, construction takes up less room, requires less energy and creates  less disruption in local communities. SLP’s first mid-rise multifamily building is underway   in downtown Seattle and is expected to be certified as a net-zero energy building.SUPPORTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  Our Urban Investment Group (UIG) has deployed over $1 billion annually in community   and economic development. INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES  Access to health care is a   challenge in many underserved urban  neighborhoods. Odyssey House Louisiana  (OHL) is a multiparty development that is  turning a former automotive factory into a state- of-the-art healthcare facility in New Orleans."
Goldman Sachs_240,"We invested $5 million to support the   renovation, which will yield 37 ,000 square feet   for the healthcare facility and another 4,000  square feet of new retail space. The development  will increase OHL ’s ability to provide behavioral  health and substance abuse treatment critical   to fighting the current battle against opioid  addiction. In addition, it will boost economic  development in the area, bringing 45 jobs to   a neighborhood with a 52 percent poverty rate  and a 37 percent unemployment rate at the  time of investment closing. OHL has remained  open throughout the entire COVID-19 crisis   and has even expanded its services, offering  telehealth in its Community Health Center and  opening a drive-through COVID-19 testing site  open to drivers and bicyclists. OHL is the   only testing site in New Orleans to accept  individuals on bikes — key for its client  population, which typically does not have   access to a private vehicle.ADVANCING  NEIGHBORHOOD   HEALTH   AND ECONOMIC   DEVELOPMENT Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Driving Inclusive Growth27 IN ECUADOR, SUPPORTING   FIRST -TIME HOME BUYERS SOCIAL BONDS TO BATTLE COVID -19 Goldman Sachs worked with Ecuador to issue a $400 million   social bond — the first social bond issuance by a sovereign —   to support Casa Para T odos, an Ecuadorian government program  designed to build affordable housing."
Goldman Sachs_245,"The issuance is expected to aid  in the purchase of more than 24,000 homes for first-time buyers from  low- and middle-income families and includes a mandate to accelerate  mortgage lending for women-led households. The social bond includes   a $300 million credit guarantee from the Inter-American Development  Bank, which lowered the cost for the Republic of Ecuador. The Casa Para Todos program represents the third subsidized social  housing program implemented in recent years by Ecuador. It is aligned  with a number of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,  including reducing poverty, increasing access to water and sanitation,  reducing inequality within and among countries, and making more cities  and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.T o help alleviate the economic and social impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, this year we have led over $15 billion of COVID-related bonds  globally. For example, we worked with the African Development Bank to  issue a $3 billion Fight COVID-19 Social Bond."
Goldman Sachs_250,"The bond provides support  and financing to countries and businesses fighting against COVID-19   and helps investors support African communities to curb the spread   of the virus and overcome the many challenges caused by the outbreak.

Goldman Sachs_290,"Giving also extends to Goldman Sachs analysts. Through the Analyst Impact Fund competition, analysts  collaborate with peers across the firm to pitch innovative nonprofits to senior leaders for grants from  Goldman Sachs Gives. In 2019, participation grew by 306 percent, as 975 analysts in 29 global offices submitted applications to  advocate on behalf of nonprofits of their choice. The year’s first-place prize — a $250,000 grant — was  awarded to a London-based analyst team representing Days for Girls, which aims to increase access to  menstrual care and education for girls in developing countries.

Goldman Sachs_295,"We are engaging in dialogue with hundreds of community partners, from small business  owners to community colleges and nonprofit leaders, to assess how we can best support communities that are   deeply impacted by the outbreak. We are undertaking initiatives to support small businesses, provide philanthropic  capital to organizations on the front lines, and mobilize our people through volunteering and giving to support   COVID-19 relief efforts globally.Investing in Philanthropy to Drive Global Growth (continued) commitment to support   communities and   small businesses Small Business Stimulus Package  Building on our decade of supporting small businesses through 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses,   the Small Business Stimulus Package will provide emergency loans to small businesses, which employ nearly   half of the American workforce and serve a critical role in the economy. A recent 10,000 Small Businesses survey of over 1,500 program participants found small businesses face   tremendous uncertainty and require immediate support:  said they have been impacted by COVID-19  said loans at reduced interest rates would help their business, and said their businesses will only be able to continue to operate   for 0–3 months96% 70% 51% Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Driving Inclusive Growth32 Goldman Sachs has committed $500 million in capital to fund low-interest loans to ensure these small businesses  have the resources they need to fund their operations, weather the current crisis, and meet their commitments to  their landlords, suppliers and employees. The Small Business Stimulus Package has already allocated funds in conjunction with two public-private partnerships  with the cities of New York and Chicago, together with several corporate and nonprofit partners. The firm is supporting its small business community globally through a rapid rollout of educational resources and  business coaching to reach small business owners in the US and UK, as well as female entrepreneurs in emerging  markets across the world, to help them navigate these challenging times."
Goldman Sachs_300,"In addition, the Goldman Sachs Foundation will provide $25 million in grants to Community Development Financial  Institution (CDFI) partners and other mission-driven lenders to increase their capacity, hire additional staff and expand  critical infrastructure. CDFIs, which have a proven history of lending to underserved businesses, need additional  resources to meet the urgent capital needs of small businesses. This effort extends our decade-long support of  CDFIs and their critical mission. The Goldman Sachs COVID-19 Relief Fund  A $30 million commitment funded by Goldman Sachs Gives — including a special matching program — launched to  support communities hardest hit by COVID-19. The Fund follows the $1 million donated to the CDC Foundation, the  Chinese Red Cross and the International Medical Corps, and will distribute grants across five specific priorities: Under the Special Employee Matching Gift Program, all non-partner employees who make a donation to COVID-19  relief efforts will have their donation matched dollar-for-dollar, up to $5 million in total."
Goldman Sachs_305,"For donations that are $25 or  less, we will match 3-to-1 . Virtual Community T eamWorks  Community TeamWorks, Goldman Sachs’ signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to maximize   their effectiveness through high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated   with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. To engage our people in the response to COVID-19,  the firm is offering a series of opportunities to support vulnerable populations remotely — including small business  owners, students and the elderly. Virtual volunteer opportunities include: serving as an emergency coach for our  10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses entrepreneurs around the world, mentoring students who need  support during school closures, and corresponding with isolated seniors in nursing homes.Investing in Philanthropy to Drive Global Growth (continued) (continued from previous page) • Assisting health providers on the front lines • Providing assistance to the most vulnerable populations • Providing economic relief for reduced and lost work •  Supporting children and families in the wake of school closures  • Supporting medical researchOUR RISK MANAGEMENT  OUR PEOPLE OUR OPERATIONSOUR FIRMMANAGING At Goldman Sachs, our commitment to inclusive growth and climate transition also informs the way we manage  our people and operations.

For this reason, we’ve set aspirational   diversity hiring goals, and are focused on fostering an inclusive and highly rewarding work environment for   all of our colleagues. We believe in a work environment that encourages our employees to reach their full potential, with ongoing  opportunities for learning and career development, a strong framework for advancement, and health and  wellness support that makes it possible for our people to achieve their personal and professional goals. DIVERSE WORKFORCE, INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE Casting a Wide Net: Goldman Sachs’ management team works closely with the firm’s Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee   to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels of seniority."
Goldman Sachs_315,"This includes a comprehensive action plan with aspirational  hiring goals for analysts and associates hired on campus or laterally, a group that accounts for more than 70 percent of the firm’s  annual hiring. In addition, as a signatory of the UK Women in Finance Charter, we are committed to ensuring women represent at least   30 percent of UK senior talent (VP and above), and we will continue to be transparent on our progress. We are confident that, based  on our persistent focus on the recruitment of and investment in diverse talent, we will meet our Charter goal by the 2023 deadline. Attracting Diverse T alent: Through targeted engagement  initiatives, the firm continues to increase its ability to recruit talent  from a variety of backgrounds and life experiences — including  those with neurological differences. An example of this in 2019  was the launch of our Neurodiversity Hiring Initiative, an eight- week paid internship that includes training for neurodivergent  candidates, as well as on-the-desk experience and coaching and  mentoring that position candidates for success at the firm."
Goldman Sachs_320,"Other key initiatives that enhance our diversity of  perspectives include: •  Returnship Initiative, which helps professionals restart their  careers after an extended absence from the workforce The strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relevance to clients all depend on a diverse workforce  and an inclusive environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe it is critical to increase diversity at all  levels of our businesses, from analysts and entry-level associates to managing directors and partners.

A prime example is our Managing Director Retention  Initiative, which includes sponsorship and the creation of  career development plans for newly promoted Asian, black,  Hispanic/Latinx and LGBT+ managing directors. Across the  globe, we are also focused on providing diverse vice presidents  the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to further  support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership  platforms."
Goldman Sachs_325,"Many other career development initiatives are  aimed at grooming diverse talent at the analyst and associate  level, with an eye toward advancement. Programs include the  Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, providing coaching from  senior leaders for black analysts and associates in the Americas  and EMEA, the Hispanic/Latinx Analysts Initiative in the  Americas, following a similar coaching and engagement model,  and the Women’s Career Strategies Initiative, a five-month  global program that provides development and networking  opportunities for nominated women.BUILDING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION INTO THE MANAGEMENT PIPELINE In 2019, Goldman Sachs launched a global initiative focused on increasing awareness of the variety of pronouns people use to express their  identity. The firm sees pronoun use as an important way of enabling employees to bring their authentic selves to work, and the initiative represents  a firmwide effort to educate colleagues on gender identity and the importance of using pronouns in building an inclusive environment. The firm launched a web page providing education on gender identity, different types of pronouns and practical guidance on using them. This includes tips for being an inclusive ally, such as not assuming pronouns for colleagues based on name or physical appearance, dealing  with mistakes, and proactive sharing of pronouns to foster an environment of awareness and respect."
Goldman Sachs_330,"Furthermore, a variety of avenues   are provided to share pronouns, including via email signatures.2019 Managing Director Class —   The Firm’s Most Diverse to Date This past year’s global managing director class was the   most diverse in the firm’s history, with new managing directors  representing 36 offices around the world. promoted millennialswomenAsianHispanic/  Latinx465 26% 2% 62%29% black LGBT+ 4% 2%•  Veterans Integration Program, which gives candidates leaving   the military an introduction to a financial services career •  Exploratory Programs, providing LGBT+, women, ethnically  diverse and social mobility candidates with the opportunity to  meet our people, learn more about roles at the firm, and develop  job-seeking skills, including networking and interviewing  •  Africa Recruiting Initiative, which identifies engineering talent  across the continent with the goal of filling summer and full-time  analyst positions (continued from previous page) PRONOUN INITIATIVE: THE FREEDOM TO SELF-IDENTIFY 2019 Campus Analyst Class —  The Firm’s Most Diverse to Date women globally  black professionals   in the Americas49%Hispanic/Latinx   in the Americas black professionals   in the UK16% 14% 10%Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Managing Our Firm36 Globally, we have over 19,000 employees who participate in employee networks. From driving  new initiatives, to moments of celebration and perspective sharing, the networks lead by example and  work to strengthen truly inclusive collaboration. In 2019, the firm’s global Disability Interest Forum (DIF) appointed more than 50 colleagues from around the firm to  serve as Disability Champions and regularly share best practices on disability inclusion, including tips for how our  people can best support colleagues with disabilities. While external studies show that approximately 30 percent of  employees have a disability, on average only 3 percent self-identify as such to their employer.1 The DIF’s Champions  Initiative represents a commitment from the firm and senior leadership to ensure colleagues with disabilities   feel appreciated for their diversity of thought and abilities by encouraging them to bring their whole, authentic  selves to work."
Goldman Sachs_335,"As part of the launch of the Champions Initiative, the DIF hosted several events in London,   New York, Singapore and Bengaluru featuring senior leaders and experts on disabilities. The group also created   a list of practices on inclusion, including how to best support colleagues with disabilities in the workplace. Most recently, we piloted the Bridge Initiative, a platform for leaders to engage in dialogue on experiences related  to race, ethnicity and personal identity — focused on reverse mentoring. Non-ethnically diverse senior leaders are  paired with black colleagues to exchange experiences and engage in learning and conversations about inclusion.ENGAGING INCLUSION CHAMPIONSExpanding Diversity and Inclusion, Supporting Our People (continued) 1 Center for Talent Innovation, 2017.Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Managing Our Firm37 ENABLING OUR PEOPLE   TO DO THEIR BEST WORK  In 2019, the firm made substantial enhancements to our  parental leave policy. This includes equal parenting leave  time for all new parents, whether they become parents  through birth, surrogacy or adoption, and regardless of the  parent’s gender or caregiver status."
Goldman Sachs_340,"In addition, the firm’s  new global parenting policy allows for 20 weeks of leave, an  increase from 16 weeks in the United States, Asia Pacific  and other regions around the world. The firm also introduced four weeks of paid family care   leave globally. This enables colleagues to care for family  members, as needed, due to serious health conditions,  foster placement or military deployment. Additionally, we  launched Pathways to Parenthood, which increases existing  stipends for adoption and surrogacy, and provides stipends  for egg retrieval and egg donation where permitted by law. Aside from leave, the firm supports expecting parents with  a wide range of programs and services."
Goldman Sachs_345,"These include a  dedicated expectant-parent coordinator who can provide  guidance on the firm’s benefits, facilities and mentoring  opportunities, and healthcare plan provisions that include a  healthy-pregnancy program, with a focus on prenatal care,  labor and delivery, and newborn care.ENHANCING OUR  SUPPORT FOR  EXPECTANT PARENTSAt Goldman Sachs, we recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace, they need support in their personal as  well as their professional lives. For this reason, we have created a strong support framework for wellness, enabling them to  better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. The past year saw significant additions to that framework,  including increased support for expectant and new parents. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our  people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. As we grapple with the impacts of  the COVID-19 pandemic, these resources remain available and we’ve continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with  the aim of maintaining physical and mental well-being, effectiveness and cohesiveness of our global community."
Goldman Sachs_350,"We rolled out  new telemedicine services that provide our employees and their families with access to physicians (24/7) through live video  or telephone. In addition, for the rest of 2020, the firm is waiving the costs of urgent care medical visits, including COVID-19  consultations. We also introduced a COVID-19 10-day family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family  members due to COVID-19 related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. Managers play an important role in fostering a culture of inclusion —   and training managers to build inclusivity is a continued focus. For  example, an online learning module for all new managers is Building an  Inclusive Environment, in which managers learn to identify and address  common diversity and inclusion considerations within their teams, and to build  a work environment that maximizes the potential of all team members."
Goldman Sachs_355,"In the  program Identity Matters: Race and Ethnicity in the Workplace, participants  learn about how race, ethnicity and social identity can shape an individual’s  workplace experience, and how dialogue about race and identity can create  trust-based relationships. Support also extends to helping leaders manage family leaves and expectant  parents. In 2019, our Global Diversity Committee and Human Capital  Management Division introduced Great Expectations: Managing Parenting- Related Leaves, an eLearning program that delivers information and best  practices for preparing for colleagues’ time off and facilitating a successful  return to work. Tips gained through this training include how to encourage new parents to  take the leave of absence, understanding how expecting a baby can generate  anxiety at home and work, and how to keep lines of communication open  during leaves so that colleagues remain up to speed on new developments  and emerging team opportunities. We believe managers play a critical role in ensuring that working parents   have the support and resources they need to thrive in the workplace — and  that they understand that the firm, and its managers, are there to support  them throughout the process.HELPING MANAGERS  STRENGTHEN A CULTURE OF  INCLUSION AND SUPPORT Goldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Managing Our Firm38 ENGAGING OUR PEOPLE   TO DRIVE IMPACT Entrepreneurship and innovation have always been a core  part of the Goldman Sachs culture."

In 2020, we are inviting pitches to six key business opportunities."
Goldman Sachs_365,"“Creating a More Sustainable Future” is highlighted as one of  these where we are looking for innovative ways to advance  sustainable economic growth and combat climate change. Now in its third year, GS Accelerate has provided resources for   13 projects, including new ideas about digital assets, alternatives  and communication across the firm. GS Accelerate continues to  help the people of Goldman Sachs express their entrepreneurial  talents and address business-critical opportunities for our clients  and the markets we serve.Through Community T eamWorks, the people of Goldman  Sachs contribute their ideas, time and expertise to drive  tangible progress in communities where we work and live.

The programs  focus on three key climate-related imperatives: moving to 100 percent procurement  of electricity from renewable sources, incorporating electric-vehicle (EV) charging  infrastructure and driving energy efficiency of offices. RE100 (Renewable Energy): Goldman Sachs has pledged to meet 100 percent of its electricity  needs through renewable sources by 2020, and by the end of 2019 we were already 98 percent  toward that target."
Goldman Sachs_380,"Last year, we completed our first power purchase agreement for on-site power  generation — through solar carports at the new headquarters of our Ayco subsidiary in upstate  New York, meeting 60 percent of the building’s electrical needs. EV100 (Electric Vehicle): Goldman Sachs has also begun a firmwide push to support electric  transport, installing 119 EV chargers at our Bengaluru campus for EV-driving employees and ground  transportation vendors. Our Ayco headquarters also installed EV chargers, and we’re committed to  installing EV infrastructure in all firm-owned offices that provide parking, and encouraging landlords  to do the same in the offices we lease. EP100 (Energy Productivity): Goldman Sachs recognizes that reducing our energy consumption  and operating efficient offices is a critical component of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The  firm’s commitment to EP100 is aligned with the “Net Zero Carbon Building” compliance pathway,  which will focus on reducing the impacts of our global real estate portfolio, by consolidating into  more efficient real estate, retrofitting existing spaces to LEED Gold or equivalent standards, or  creating green campuses."
Goldman Sachs_385,"Our new BREEAM “Excellent” certified London office has achieved a  50 percent reduction in utility consumption compared to our previous campus due to 100 percent  LED lighting.

We piloted an  ESG self-assessment survey with 80 vendors in  industries perceived to have the highest ESG risk  exposure to better understand the controls   in place to manage environmental, labor and  human rights requirements detailed in our  Vendor Code of Conduct. And we are leveraging  these findings to further enhance our responsible  supply chain practices. Our goals for the coming  year also include a deeper assessment of  vendors in industries exposed to high risk of  slavery and human trafficking."
Goldman Sachs_390,"A key priority for our firm is fostering opportunities  with small, as well as women- and minority- owned, businesses, with the aim of achieving  a supply chain that reflects the diversity of our  people and our clients. In 2019, we focused on  increasing the firm’s network and access to  diverse businesses, expanding our memberships  with certifying agencies. In 2020, we will enhance  our reporting capabilities and we will  remain focused on our 2025 goals.We are committed to diverting 100 percent of business waste   from landfill by the end of 2020. Our responsible waste management  practices prioritize reducing the amount of waste we generate,  maximizing recycling and composting, and utilizing waste-to-energy  facilities where available. In 2019, the firm made significant efforts   toward these commitments."
Goldman Sachs_395,"Paper: We launched #goDigital, a campaign to eliminate 10 million print  pages of output annually from our operations. Opportunities to reduce  consumption range from eliminating paper-based client communications  to fully leveraging digital media for internal communications and reducing  reliance on printed promotional material. In addition, we eliminated paper  cups in our offices and shifted to reusable mugs, eliminating more than  200 tons of waste annually. Plastics: We met our commitment to remove 85 percent of single-use  plastics from our global operations, including plastic bottles and straws,  and plastic film presentation covers and binders. Food: We are also working to reduce food waste in our cafeterias and  micro-market cafes."
Goldman Sachs_400,"In January 2019, we began to partner with Rethink  Food in New York to ensure that excess, unused food is donated and  transitioned into ready-to-eat, nutrition-dense meals. Through this  partnership, and collaboration with the Conrad Hotel, we were able   to transform more than 32,000 pounds of food into the equivalent of  45,000 meals for New York City families in need. Furniture: We responsibly managed the disposal of 30,000 pieces   of existing furniture when moving from our legacy campus in London   to Plumtree Court — ensuring nothing was   sent to landfill. By partnering with Waste  Match, we are donating more than   9,000 pieces of furniture to local charities,  schools and medical establishments,   while responsibly recycling an additional   500 tons of metal.

This Framework, as well as our other  sustainability-related policies, was developed with the consultation  of stakeholders, including investors, NGOs and regulators. Our  Framework includes a number of basic tenets: •  We manage environmental and social risks with the same care   and discipline as we do other business risks •  We weigh environmental and social impacts in all relevant   business selection decisions •  We engage with clients to identify significant ESG issues, and   help them adopt appropriate safeguards and sustainable practices   where feasible •  We decline assignments when client engagement is not possible,  when potential impacts cannot be mitigated, and when unacceptable  risks conflict with our environmental and social policy guidelines Our Framework also helps us work with clients to develop  environmental and social risk disclosures as appropriate. In addition, we proactively monitor developments — from emerging ESG issues  to evolving best practices — and periodically review and update our  guidelines to reflect these developments. Goldman Sachs was one of the first financial institutions to underscore  the urgency of addressing climate change through our EPF ."

We work with clients  across all industries on climate transition, including with power sector  clients to help them diversify and reduce GHG emissions to transition  in-line with the Paris Agreement. Because risk management is so critical to responsibly running our firm,  we focus on training our people in risk management globally, including  training with respect to environmental and social risk.

In this spirit, Goldman Sachs has published an inaugural report (see page 56) that details our approach  to managing climate-related risks and opportunities across our businesses and operations, including the initial steps we have taken on  transition and physical climate-risk scenario analysis. Our approach is multifaceted across both opportunities and risks and continues to advance as both the market and our clients’ needs evolve  and as data, technology and tools improve over time.

In 2019, Goldman Sachs identified and managed EHS risks in a number  of potential transactions and portfolio companies, and in some cases, forwent the transaction if risks were high and could not be mitigated. For  example, when the firm was completing the due diligence on a multi- family property acquisition, our expanded due diligence scope identified  that the on-site water supply well was being inadequately treated. After  additional diligence into the causes and impacts of this water quality  concern, we decided not to participate in the transaction."
Goldman Sachs_440,"In another case, when considering the acquisition of an industrial  portfolio with a dozen facilities in Europe, we identified a number of  significant deficiencies in EHS governance. Working with the Operational  Risk Management & Analysis Environmental Specialist Team, we required  detailed EHS audits as a condition for the approval of the transaction. As a result, detailed corrective action plans were developed for each  facility to address the deficiencies, including additional staffing and  enhanced authority of corporate EHS leadership, as well as development  of a firmwide EHS governance process and improvements to localized  EHS procedures. (continued from previous page) A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSUREGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report Managing Our Firm45 Managing Risks (continued) Appropriate oversight by our management and Board of  Directors, as well as strong policies and practices, are key  contributors to our ability to effectively manage a broad  spectrum of financial and nonfinancial risks across our  businesses, including with respect to ESG considerations. Our Board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the  management of the firm’s most significant risks, placing significant  focus on reputational risk and management’s operation of the firm  responsibly for the long term."
Goldman Sachs_445,"The Board’s Public Responsibilities  Committee (PRC) has primary oversight of our firmwide approach to  sustainability and related risks, including through the review of key  ESG policies. Our ESG policies and procedures provide transparency  into our practices and are generally developed with the consultation  of stakeholders, including regulators and investors. Significantly, ESG and sustainability oversight is not limited to just the PRC,  but also informs discussions with other committees and the full Board on topics ranging from climate risk to human capital  management to the firm’s broader sustainable finance initiatives. Oversight of the firm’s culture is an important element of how the Board engages on the firm’s reputation, particularly  because our people are our greatest asset. Our Board holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining and  communicating the firm’s culture throughout the firm."
Goldman Sachs_450,"Core to our success is that our focus on risk and reputation extends  throughout every level of Goldman Sachs. To this end, our people are trained in our Business Standards and Principles, which were recently distilled into our Core Values,  and underscore the responsibility of every employee to uphold our culture of teamwork, excellence, personal initiative and  accountability. At the management level, our firm’s committee structure serves to emphasize these points. Our committees are  generally composed of senior managers from our first and second lines of defense. These committees have specific oversight  or decision-making responsibilities for various risk management activities."
Goldman Sachs_455,"For example, while our Enterprise Risk Committee  is globally responsible for overseeing all of the firm’s risks, both financial and nonfinancial, our Firmwide Reputational Risk  Committee is responsible for vetting transactions that have the potential for heightened reputational risk.RISK -CENTERED  GOVERNANCE Our culture has been a cornerstone of our business and performance throughout our 150-year history. Our 14 Business Principles, which   were codified in 1979, outline our commitment to our clients and our cultural expectations, including how teamwork, excellence, personal  initiative and accountability are integral to our long-term success. These principles continue to guide us and were recently distilled into our  Core Values, which inform everything that we do. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines our shared responsibility to our clients, our colleagues and our communities. Goldman  Sachs is committed to ensuring our culture of integrity remains a core value."
Goldman Sachs_460,"We remain intensely focused on the impact that the conduct of our people can have on our firm’s reputation. To further elevate and reinforce  this focus, we have now created a Firmwide Conduct Committee, which is globally responsible for the oversight of conduct risk. In particular, the Firmwide Conduct Committee seeks to ensure that our frameworks and policies appropriately mitigate the risk that our  people fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and Core Values, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities   to the firm, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community.

We also believe in the importance of  providing greater transparency on our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities  across our business and operations. Our inaugural T ask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) Report provides an  overview of our strategy and approach to climate-related risks and opportunities, including how the  management and oversight of climate change is integrated across our global business. We also include  in this report the initial steps we have undertaken on climate risk scenario analysis to understand the  impacts of both transition risk and physical risk. We recognize that climate change is highly complex and that it is inherently difficult to project  how related financial risks will materialize across the global economy and markets."
Goldman Sachs_535,"In addition,  climate scenario analysis is relatively new and evolving rapidly, including with respect to underlying  assumptions, methodologies and data. As such, this report represents the first step in our journey  with the commitment to deepening our understanding of and advancing our approach to   climate-related risks and opportunities over time. Climate-related opportunities and risks manifest in many different ways across our businesses. We see significant  opportunities across our financing, investing, asset management, advisory and risk management activities as we work with  our clients to help address the climate challenge. At the same time, extreme weather events may disrupt operations or  affect the value of our investments, negative financial impacts on clients from climate change may increase credit risk, and  involvement in certain industries associated with climate change may pose reputational risk."
Goldman Sachs_540,"Given the broad-based impacts  of climate change, our cohesive strategy leverages the breadth of our global businesses and the depth of our expertise and  insights to advance climate-related opportunities and to manage climate risk. Our strategy includes a 10-year, $750 billion strategic target to finance, invest and advise clients across nine sustainable  growth themes, which underlie climate transition and inclusive growth. In addition, given global economies for the  foreseeable future are dependent on fossil-based energy and carbon-intensive activities, we are committed to supporting  clients across all industries in their efforts to accelerate their climate transition and doing so in an orderly manner. This   enables us to not only better serve the interests of our clients but also more effectively manage our own risk exposures. In 2019, we strengthened our firmwide efforts by establishing the Sustainable Finance Group (SFG), which reports to the  Chairman’s Office and is responsible for partnering with our global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise  and drive innovative solutions for our clients."
Goldman Sachs_545,"This effort is supported by a cross-divisional steering group of senior business  leaders to deliver the breadth of our capabilities. Our strategy also entails understanding and managing climate-related physical, transition and reputational risks. This is  embedded both in our comprehensive firmwide risk management approach and more specifically in our climate change risk  management framework. In addition to managing risk across our client activities and related balance sheet exposure and  reputational risk, we continue to adopt best practices to reduce our own carbon footprint and integrate resiliency into our  global operations. Underlying our strategy is an ongoing commitment to deepening our understanding and knowledge of, and progressing our  approach to, managing climate risks and advancing market opportunities."
Goldman Sachs_550,"To that end, we leverage the lessons learned from  managing our own business and serving our clients, as well as from our external stakeholder engagement, to help inform the  work we do and further best practices across the financial services industry and more broadly. We also harness our research insights  and thought leadership to help inform markets and policy, and engage in broader partnerships to further market solutions. TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report59Governance  Given climate-related impacts manifest across our businesses in different ways, oversight and management of climate  change is integrated into our existing governance structure. This helps to ensure that climate change is strategically  managed and the expertise of the firm is both integrated and leveraged across relevant committees and functions. At the most senior level, under the oversight of the Board of Directors and at the direction of senior management, we   are committed to serving our clients and delivering robust risk management, including on climate-related opportunities and  risks."
Goldman Sachs_555,"Our focus on not only clients but on effective risk and controls is core to our commitment to excellence, as reflected   in our Core Values, Business Principles, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Board of Directors:  Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its committees are responsible for overseeing the management of the firm’s  most significant risks, placing significant focus on reputational risk and management’s operation of the firm for the   long term. •  The Board’s Public Responsibilities Committee (PRC) provides oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and  sustainability issues affecting the firm, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the PRC  receives updates on the firm’s Environmental Policy Framework (EPF), which serves as an ambitious roadmap for how  we seek to leverage our people, capital and ideas to address critical environmental challenges and promote sustainable  economic growth across our businesses. The EPF also includes environmental and social risk guidelines, including for  carbon-intensive sectors."
Goldman Sachs_560,"•  The Risk Committee of the Board oversees the firm’s overall risk-taking tolerance and management of financial and non- financial risks, including climate risk. In this respect, the Risk Committee provides oversight of the firm’s Risk Appetite  Statement (RAS), which conveys the firm’s view of its risk culture, risk appetite and risk management philosophies,  including those related to climate change. TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report60Firmwide Committees:  In addition to Board-level oversight, we have a series of firm-level committees with risk management mandates that have  oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities and environmental, social and governance  (ESG) issues, including relevant climate change considerations. At a firmwide level, the Enterprise Risk Committee  oversees all of our financial and non-financial risks, including climate-related risk. In addition, we have firm-level risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions  and entities."
Goldman Sachs_565,"For example, the Firmwide Capital Committee, which approves and oversees debt-related transactions,  including balance sheet-related commitments, integrates relevant climate-related considerations. For our own operations,  the Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee provides oversight over operational risk and resiliency,  including physical risks relating to climate change. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the reputational impact of transactions and activities that they  review. The Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee provides oversight over transactions that may have heightened  reputational risk, which includes considerations relating to environmental and social factors, such as climate-related  reputational risk.

As part of their  responsibilities, the following three divisions/functions play a specific role in managing climate-related risks and  opportunities and ensuring that we continue to advance our insights and expertise."
Goldman Sachs_580,"•  Risk Division: The Risk Division has a range of climate-related functions, working with business units and control  groups on risk identification and stress-testing activities. The division also assesses financial risks of counterparties and  transactions, including credit risk. In addition, the division oversees the firm’s operational resilience framework, which  factors in potential impacts from climate-related risks on the firm’s activities. •  Executive Office (EO) — Sustainable Finance Group (SFG): The SFG, which reports to the Office of the Chairman,   is responsible for partnering with the firm’s global businesses to deliver leading sustainability expertise and capabilities  to our clients and drive innovative market solutions that advance climate transition and inclusive growth. SFG also  engages with the firm’s stakeholders to stay abreast of and, where relevant, help inform sustainable finance and climate  change-related policy."
Goldman Sachs_585,"In addition, SFG works with the Business Intelligence Group, the Risk Division and the business  units on firmwide environmental and social risk management and related guidelines. By being part of the EO and  working across all of the global businesses, clients and stakeholders, SFG brings together the breadth of our knowledge  and capabilities and ensures we continue to deliver our insights and expertise. •  Services Division — Corporate Services & Real Estate (CSRE), Crisis Management Group: The Services Division  provides essential commercial advisory and management services to enable the firm’s flow of business, drive  operational efficiency, manage risk and deliver the world’s best work experience and environment. CSRE partners   with the Crisis Management Group to assess and plan for near- and long-term climate-related risks across our operations  through infrastructure and business continuity reviews of the firm’s global corporate real estate portfolio. This enables  climate-related risk to be actively monitored and threats to be minimized to ensure the firm operates continuously  through and swiftly recovers from any business disruption."
Goldman Sachs_590,"Cross-Divisional Groups:  In addition to the specific divisions/functions, we have established cross-divisional steering groups to more effectively  leverage the firm’s capabilities and activities and to ensure a holistic, firmwide approach to managing climate-related risks  and opportunities. These include:  •  Sustainable Finance Steering Group: Comprised of senior leaders responsible for integrating sustainability expertise  across our divisions and bringing our capabilities together across the firm. The group convenes periodically to guide  and support firmwide sustainable finance efforts relating to key strategic initiatives and client delivery, while providing  leadership for cross-divisional work streams and new opportunities. •  Climate Change Risk Steering Group: Comprised of representatives from the Risk Division, Services Division and the  Executive Office that are responsible for evaluating climate-related scenario analysis and the broader TCFD assessment. This group also reviews the implementation of the strategic climate risk management approach outlined in this report to  strengthen climate-related financial risk integration across our businesses and practices."
Goldman Sachs_595,"TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report62Strategy — Advancing the Opportunity As markets and client activity shift in response to climate change, we have a substantial opportunity to harness innovative  capital market tools and partner with our clients to help accelerate their climate transition. In addition, our ability to  leverage the breadth of our capabilities, our commitment to continuously deepening our expertise and refining our insights,  and applying these both across our own operations and in serving our clients’ needs, ensures we stay front-footed in  integrating climate change opportunities and risks. In December 2019, we announced a new sustainable finance target of $750 billion of financing, investing and advisory  activity by 2030. This target encompasses activities across nine strategic growth themes, which are rooted in 10+ years   of market research, focused on climate transition and inclusive growth. Areas of focus in our climate transition activity  include clean energy, sustainable transport, sustainable food and agriculture, waste and material, as well as ecosystem  services — areas where we can help scale technology and solutions through greater and more efficient capital  deployment."
Goldman Sachs_600,"In addition to this target, we have expanded our work with clients more broadly to help them with their  climate transition and in ensuring sustainable growth more broadly, and we are harnessing innovative market solutions   to help clients better manage and adapt to climate risks. Leveraging the Breadth of Our Businesses  We leverage our capabilities across financing, advisory, risk management solutions, asset management and investing  to help our clients achieve their climate-related goals, facilitate the low-carbon transition, and strengthen adaptation and  resiliency.

In addition, where appropriate, we advocate for  effective climate policy to help inform ways to advance market solutions that can help address climate change."
Goldman Sachs_615,"The following are examples. •  Paris Climate Agreement: We have actively engaged in making the business case for global climate action, including  support for the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement. We were one of the first US companies to commit to the White House  American Business Act on Climate Pledge in 2015; we signed an open letter alongside 29 other CEOs in 2017 to support  the US staying in the Paris Agreement; and more recently, we were part of a group of 80+ CEOs and labour leaders  reiterating our support that staying in the Paris Agreement will strengthen US competitiveness in global markets. •  Carbon pricing: We have long articulated the need for governments to provide transparency around the costs of  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to create long-term value for GHG emissions reductions. More recently, in a  December 2019 editorial, our CEO David Solomon underscored the urgency and business case for climate transition and  called for governments to put a price on carbon."
Goldman Sachs_620,"In February 2020, Goldman Sachs, alongside more than 25 companies,  joined as a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) to support a revenue-neutral carbon fee and  dividend plan for the US. •  Catalyzing climate finance: We have continued to leverage our market insights to help catalyze greater capital flows   to address climate change. In 2019, we joined the CEO-led Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) as one of  seven founding members, to support greater mobilization of climate finance flows. In September 2019, CFLI delivered  its Financing the Low-Carbon Future report to the UN to inform ways to further mobilize private climate finance at the  scale and speed needed to support a rapid and orderly transition to a low-carbon global economy. •  Integrating climate-related risks and opportunities: In 2019, Goldman Sachs Asset Management teamed up with a  select group of other leading asset managers to advance climate-related investment among national sovereign wealth  funds (SWFs)."
Goldman Sachs_625,"Known as the One Planet Asset Managers Initiative, this collaboration supports the efforts of the One  Planet SWF Working Group, composed of leading sovereign wealth funds, to drive a deeper consideration of the impact  of climate change on investment portfolios. Operational Best Practices In addition to harnessing the breadth of our businesses to help our clients with their climate transition and scaling  innovative market solutions to address climate change, Goldman Sachs is committed to being a leader in implementing  sustainability practices that minimize the impact of our global operations on the environment. For example, we have been  carbon neutral from 2015 onward across our global direct Scope 1, indirect (market-based) Scope 2, and Scope 3 business  travel emissions. Additionally, by year-end 2020, we are committed to procuring 100% renewable energy and attaining  LEED Gold or equivalent for 70 percent of our global corporate real estate footprint. In December 2019, we established a new suite of 2025 operational sustainability goals with a focus on strategic,  collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation, as outlined in our Sustainability Report."
Goldman Sachs_630,"The firm has been a  member of RE100 since 2015 and recently joined additional initiatives EV100 and EP100 with ambitious commitments   to electrify transport and deploy smarter energy use — making us the first US company to become a member of all three   of The Climate Group’s global corporate leadership initiatives to accelerate the clean energy transition. TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report65Risk Management  Because we are a global financial services firm with clients operating in diverse sectors and offices across many   countries, climate change presents a range of potential risk considerations across our businesses and activities. For  example, climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary  locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients and also may adversely affect the  value of our investments. Climate change may also have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients, which  may decrease cash flows from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures  to these clients. Additionally, our reputation may be impacted as a result of our involvement, or our clients’ involvement,   in certain industries or projects associated with climate change."
Goldman Sachs_635,"The table below provides a description of the range of climate-related risk considerations. Risk Description  Market Physical and transition risk could impact the value of assets in which we make markets and invest. CreditCounterparty financial performance and collateral values could deteriorate as the transition   and physical impacts of climate change manifest over time. LiquidityClimate-related disruptions could impact the availability and accessibility of capital in markets for  certain sectors and securities. OperationalIncreased severity of climate-related events could impact our office locations and disrupt our   systems, people and processes across our global footprint."
Goldman Sachs_640,"ReputationGrowing stakeholder focus on corporate action to meet emissions reduction targets can result   in increased reputational risk and reduced client and employee loyalty, investor divestment and   impacts to client activity. LegalClimate-related disclosures are increasingly important and climate-related litigation could also result  from stranded assets, acute climate events or resulting market price declines. TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report66Climate-Risk Scenario Analysis Our overall business structure, strategy and comprehensive risk management provide a strong foundation for   managing and mitigating these potential risks. However, climate change is highly complex and non-linear, with many  uncertainties. In addition, new data, tools, and expectations are continuously evolving."
Goldman Sachs_645,"As such, we have a climate   change risk management framework, which includes stress testing based on an initial set of scenarios. As part of   ongoing implementation, we are undertaking further refinement of the scenarios with the goal of improving their risk  management benefit. As a global financial institution, we use a variety of stress-testing techniques to calculate the potential impact of a wide  range of potential market moves. We perform stress testing on a regular basis to ensure a comprehensive analysis   of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks in anticipation of market events or conditions, which include climate  considerations. For climate stress testing, we perform both (i) transition risk stress tests on the value of our balance   sheet-related equity and credit assets, and (ii) physical risk stress tests on our global properties."
Goldman Sachs_650,"The following is what   we have initially undertaken:  (i) T ransition Risk Stress T est Transition risk arises from changes to policy, technology and consumer preferences over time that reduce reliance on  carbon-intensive products and services. The composition of industries, particularly in the energy sector, will change as  a result of compliance with climate policy changes such as the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Since individual  countries will implement decarbonization policies in different ways, changes to industries will also depend on where they  are located and how the policies evolve over time. Climate policy changes introduce financial risks to financial institutions  that may own or finance companies whose value could be affected. To measure these risks, we perform transition risk  stress testing."
Goldman Sachs_655,"Currently, we perform transition risk stress tests under two scenarios: 1) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is fully  implemented by all countries; and 2) a scenario in which the Paris Agreement is partially implemented in line with current  policy plans. In implementing each scenario, we assume that a credible policy change is announced and that the market  consequently adjusts credit ratings and prices of affected companies and trades. In each stress test, we estimate the  change in credit ratings that would result from each policy change as well as the changes in equity and credit prices that  are consistent with those credit rating changes. We then reprice all affected assets on our balance sheet to measure the  total change in value that would result under each scenario. (ii) Physical Risk Stress T est Physical risk arises from changes to the environment that are produced directly by the continuing concentration of GHGs  in the atmosphere and the consequent increases in temperature, precipitation, sea level and other environmental factors."
Goldman Sachs_660,"Physical changes in the environment may affect the value of properties directly; an increase in sea level, coupled with  more extreme precipitation and hurricanes, would affect the value of coastal properties, for example. But physical risks  may also influence the value of assets indirectly by reducing local economic growth, worsening health or lowering labor  productivity. The magnitude of physical risks that manifest is linked to transition scenarios, since GHG emissions and their  resulting impacts will be determined by policy-driven mitigation measures. In our physical stress test, we examine the effect of heat stress, water stress, extreme precipitation, sea level rise, and  flooding on our properties. The climate policy that we assume in our stress test is a high-emissions policy."
Goldman Sachs_665,"We assume that  the concentration of GHGs increases even more than expected under current policies and that therefore temperature and  other environmental risks worsen relative to business-as-usual expectations. TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report67(iii) Next Steps These initial stress tests were helpful in understanding relative sensitivities and providing a starting point for further  refining the analysis. To that end, we are working to enhance our transition risk and physical risk stress tests along a  number of dimensions in order to improve their decision usefulness. In our transition risk stress test, we are examining  how to increase its flexibility so that we can run a wider range of scenarios that incorporate more varied policy changes. Similarly, in our physical risk stress tests, we are exploring how we might incorporate a wider range of policy changes,  such as full adherence to the Paris Agreement."
Goldman Sachs_670,"We are also considering how to add more physical risks to our physical  stress test, such as wildfires, and how to better estimate the effects of physical risks on asset values. More broadly, we  are investigating whether the transition risk and physical risk stress tests should be unified or whether it would be more  beneficial to keep them separate. Comprehensive Risk Management Approach  Business Structure and Strategy:  As a global financial institution with a diverse set of businesses and clients, our business structure and strategy help us  manage overall climate-related risks and increase our ability to participate in climate-related opportunities. •  A significant part of our client financings in our Investment Banking business are provided through our underwritten  offerings where we connect users of capital with investors versus holding financings on our balance sheet. For  underwritings, how we perform due diligence, make business selection decisions and provide relevant disclosures   are critical and form part of our comprehensive risk management approach."
Goldman Sachs_675,"•  Our Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management businesses largely relate to client assets and are  integrating ESG considerations, including climate-related strategies for our clients, as well as taking into account factors  that could be material in valuing performance and risk, such as those relating to climate change. •  Our Global Markets business is highly diversified and managed in a way that reflects real-time information and shifts   in potential risks. Given this current business mix and structure, and based on our initial stress tests, the direct balance sheet impacts  from climate change are relatively modest. However, our ability to effectively manage climate risks and opportunities is  important across our businesses in serving our clients and managing and protecting existing pools of assets while   creating opportunities for further growth. Business Activities:  We believe that effective risk management is critical to our success."
Goldman Sachs_680,"Accordingly, we have a well-established enterprise  risk management (ERM) framework, which is ultimately overseen by our Board. The ERM framework employs a  comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and it is designed to enable robust risk management processes  through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our business activities. As part of our risk management approach, we have firmwide policy guidelines and dedicated teams that support business  selection and review processes:TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report68•  Firmwide policy guidelines for carbon-intensive sectors and activities, such as coal-fired power generation, palm   oil, and oil & gas are included in our Environmental Policy Framework (EPF). The EPF was updated in December   2019 to restrict certain carbon-related business activities and to strengthen our work with clients to help them with   their climate transition. •  Upfront business selection and due diligence processes that include 14 key sector and cross-sector guidelines, and  worst-case-loss calculations for physical commodities in certain carbon-intensive sectors, complement the EPF ."
Goldman Sachs_685,"These  guidelines and tools are leveraged across the various activities of the firm at the business selection stage and through  designated committee review processes. There are escalation mechanisms and protocols undertaken at each stage. Where relevant, we also incorporate extreme weather and flooding event probability into worst-case-loss calculations   for certain transactions. See Environmental and Social Risk Management for more information. •  Risk Identification and Scenario Design, which is a periodic process that we undertake to review the materiality of  evolving risks in our business activities over a two-year forward-looking horizon, includes the assessment of impact from  climate change."
Goldman Sachs_690,"In addition, our ongoing risk monitoring from credit, liquidity, and market risk management teams, mark-to-market portfolio  valuations, dynamic hedging, and insurance requirements where relevant, enables overall position management and  exposure reduction where potential material risks are identified. Operations:  For our physical assets, the Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee oversees business continuity planning  and crisis management efforts, including planning for climate-related risks. The committee oversees efforts related to: •  Regular resiliency reviews  •  Comprehensive infrastructure and business continuity assessments  • Overall real estate site selection and management strategy •  Business Continuity Planning and remote access infrastructure We also consider such risks through all stages of our corporate real estate strategy, from site selection and building design  to occupancy and facilities management. Within our operations, we utilize various metrics and dashboards to prioritize and  track risks that pose a threat to the health and safety of our employees or to the firm’s critical infrastructure assets that  support core business functions.TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report69Metrics and Targets Business Opportunities: The firm has had a long-standing commitment to harnessing market solutions to address climate  change. One of the key ways we have been doing this is by mobilizing capital to scale clean energy, given energy is the  largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions."
Goldman Sachs_695,"Clean energy also brings benefits of energy diversification and security,  technology innovation, and green jobs, as well as health benefits. Since 2006, we have mobilized over $115 billion in clean  energy financing and investments. Going forward, we have a more expansive goal to deploy $750 billion in sustainable finance over the next 10 years, with   a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth. Please refer to our Sustainability Report for more information about our  Sustainable Finance Goals. Operations and GHG Emissions: To ensure we remain a leader in implementing sustainability practices and reducing  operational risk, our Services Division is committed to minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment and  adopting best practices."
Goldman Sachs_700,"We have been carbon neutral across our global operations and business travel since 2015, and  are progressing on our 2020 operational goals. Additionally, alongside the sustainable finance target, we announced new  operational goals for 2025, with a focus on strategic, collaborative partnerships that drive market transformation. See Our Operational Impact. We currently measure, disclose and reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our own activities, and also   disclose Scope 3 emissions related to business travel. See page 47 for our latest GHG emissions and energy use data   for 2019."
Goldman Sachs_705,"TCFD AppendixGoldman Sachs 2019 Sustainability Report70The Path Forward  This report is the first step in our application of TCFD recommendations. Goldman Sachs is committed to continuing  our work with various stakeholders, including clients, shareholders, peer banks and other key constituents to improve  methodologies on climate-related risk analysis and disclosures and to furthering climate-related opportunities to  facilitate the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy.
